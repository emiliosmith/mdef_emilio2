It is unfair that environmental activist has to put their own live at risk for protect any kind of species or just their territory, like Berta Caceres an environmental activist that was murderer in her house There are some many examples of communities that lives almost free of needs of capitalism, like the Zapatistas. They have been told to people many times that we have to fight in our own territories with our own tools, so that\u00b4s why my fight starts with design. My fight as a designer is to improve the design solutions with new knowledge, working with people and be responsible and proactive about the social and environmental impact. My proffesional identity From the meetings Be more structured in order to communicate and organize better the information or the goals of a project or intervention, for some people it is better to understand a chart or an infographic rather than a bullet presentation Be more enthusiastic, first impression never forgets, with that in mind in order to work with groups of people, it will be important to engage with them since the beginning. Colorful, not everything is white and black , and broad or holistic, not everything it can be done from the design point of view, in some occasions a designer has to take a step back mostly in cooperative project. Personal development I have worked in the past year as a designer responsible of develop may kind of projects, but hardly those projects leave space to experiment or try another knowledge or discipline, for me is important at first instance to communicate an idea effectively and to engage passionately and effective to a group of people or community because always a design solution has to be involve in a network. For me it is important to have a broad understanding of all new knowledge and or technologies in order to push the envelope and go forward in the design process, because that knowledge is a medium to potentiate the design solution. Furthermore, I will search to engage with several disciplines in order to have a vast point of views, always having in mind that the people that have the problem is always the ones that can have the solution.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 Choosing weak signals At first instance it was very difficult just to choose one, even two cards, because each card at some point represent a interesting topic full of possibilities. It is hard from an industrial designer point of view, not to be triggered by each card and to jump immediately to a design intervention. To many possibilities at the beginning just play with your head in a bad way, tearing your efforts in so many directions, and in a co-depending, apprehensive exercise, one starts to making a Frank-enstein of a design solution as an excuse to use at least 5 cards. While we were hiking uphill, I was searching in my old bag of ideas for one that fits this Franken-stein solution but as we arrive at the top and we start to listen to Xavi, it hit me. I doesn\u2019t matter if I have to use the card for one signal or another, because at the end I want my fight to address the environmental issue, it doesn\u2019t matter at what level or from what perspective, it going to land there. At the top, the first task was achieved, I had selected Climate Conscience. What I understand about the card is environmental issues as the Climate and its crisis, they are very broad and maybe technical in some points because it is transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary, if we keep the subject in a certain level of conciseness maybe we can be more effective, maybe we can design interventions like acupuncture just to work exactly at one point to unchain the reac-tion that we want. The other agenda that I was thinking on, appear to me as Xavi was talking about the change in the use of the land in Vall\u00e9s county, this agenda is the one that has to address to a shift in the eco-nomic system. In order to fight for climate, you have to pass through the economic system which is enable by the political power being their biggest threat, not just for environment, also for socie-ty. So I asked myself: Wouldn\u00b4t be nice to design an alternative system that allows to the people to be self-sufficient, non-governmental dependent and that allows to thrive within the planetary boundaries? Multiscalar diagram Other trigger that I have in mind was the Circular Economy and Climate Justice. At these moments I am thinking that there are many examples that address the climate crisis in a personal or domestic sphere, but what about in a corporate level or a SMEs level, with activities rather than residues separation or energy saving. If we are naming that economic system is the biggest threat to climate, so how can business could make a transition to a less harm or regenera-tive system. At the moment I have many questions that are going in different directions. Another question is how can we increase climate conscience to push people to a paradigm shift in their economic activities? Can climate conscience be the end? Or is a way to an end? If these is the case, what it would be de end? Until today my biggest concern are the resources management or self-sufficiency and the econom-ic system. I\u2019m still working in this scales Collaborative design space Finding resonance At these point with my peers at the panel 5 State Futures - Land justice - distributed infrastructure = redistribution of opportunities - Post- passport - displacement - authorities- social movements - Radical Tech -Political Tech Futures, I feel that I was pushing the agenda for self-sufficiency re-gions or maybe in domestic. I tried to make the connections between some triggers like the reuse of tech like a strategy for self-sufficiency and also how it could lead to a change in the economic system Next steps \u2013Someone you would like to contact Fab cities El Hierro, Blue Economy example, M\u00f3nica Navarro, CEO y Co-Fundadora de Delicious & Sons, type B business example.

Another experiment I would like to do Is to measure the impact on people of the data visualization, what I mean is that there is a lot of examples, exhibitions, data representation, art works, activism and so on, about the environmental crisis caused by human activities, I would like to know Is how much or how little a person changes their behavior after be exposed to an information of these kind. Because I would like to understand why is taking us so long for making changes in the way that we are living. \u2013A new skill you\u2019d like to add to your personal development plan to Use the magic wand to appear solutions out of nowhere to climate crisis. An skill that I want to add is to fix something broke, like a computer,a printer or a car engine just following a simple manual, like the \u201cEl libro de la familia\u201d just to understand how easy or had could be reuse, remanufacture or repair all the resources around us.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"seminars/03-Bio%20and%20Agri%20Zero/","text":"Bio and Agri Zero \u00b6 The observation in microscope \u00b6 The samples taken for the medium of yeast DIY , were taken from the from the trash bin or containers, each container have to ways of open. 1.

Design a mutant \u00b6 PET-eater Mycelium \u00b6 *References https://2019.igem.org/Team:Humboldt_Berlin/Description http://2016.igem.org/Team:Tianjin/Description The example from inspiration talks about an algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii used as a chassis for having an enzyme that can break the polymers chains into monomers by degrading it basically with two kinds of enzymes, PETase and MHETase. The PETase degrades PET into MHET (mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid) and MHETase degrades MHET into TPA (terephthalic acid) and EG (ethylene glycol). So my mutant is to take a Mycelium as a chassis with this types of enzymes and spread it in landfills in which there are the most amount of the PET unused, mixed therefore un-recycled. The objective is degrading the most amount of PET available in a Landfill and reduce the volume of it, allowing other process for handle the mixed waste more efficiently. Scientific paper review \u00b6 Mycelium as a biological network (an example of biomimicry). \u00b6 From the example shared in the seminar about the networks created from mycelium, I start reading and searching more about this. If we can talk about the flow of nutrients in the mycelium network could be used as a biomimicry concept extrapolated to different kinds of networks; as an example if we talk about decentralized manufacturing, we can design routes for or networks of local manufacturers, craftsman or workshops as input of flow or as a node then we can distribute the \u201cnutrient\u201d created by them in the network. Each node or manufacture will metabolize a good that could be flow as a nutrient in the must optimal path within the network. Could it be the same as the Graph Theory and find the optimal way to transfer atoms, instead of having big manufactures, we can have smaller ones with less consumption of resources, less environmental impact, more cooperation and wealth distribution.

For this assignment of having one self as a mirror for design for other (1pp), the question: \u201cwhat magic machine could help me in my life?\u201d was without doubt a machine that could tell me what the other people is felling, and not only to know the felling but to feel what they feel, to feel it in my own body.

Insight \u00b6 One thing that I can catch from the dynamic is that when you put yourself in the 1pp perspective you can use your own self context and body in order to reflect in the other anything. In that action you can see yourself reflected at the same time, therefore you recognize something about yourself in the other and the similarities start to appearing, having at some point some level of empathy. That maybe can be obvious in some point but it is clear for me and I hope that is the same with others, that one design for the other, the interaction between people or designing for people and whit people shape us. We have to design having in mind the other person, we could design for connection, meaningful interaction or whatever; but the main thing that shape our design is designing for the other, it shapes us, shape our practice and shape the characteristics of the interventions. Design for the other make us empathetic and humble, realizing that, no matter what, always has to be another self, another entity that at the end has to thrive trough the design intervention. With that in mind the design activity makes us humbles, emphatics and vulnerable, and make sense with the words from Ron Wakkary to Arturo Escobar, etc. Not many people are willing to be vulnerable or empathic (for their own reasons), and the question that lies here is, can we teach to the non-designer how to design for the other in order to transform them into a more emphatic been? Can a non-designer design for another entity such as the environment? Therefore, having a meaningful rapport. Can the non-designer could be more emphatic with the environment or immigrants, when he, she or they are designing with them and for them? The point is understanding why if must of the people is aware of the environmental and social crisis caused by capitalism, no one is willing to make a radical change or systemic change. 1PP EXPLORATION \u00b6 Searching for meaningful interactions \u00b6 Guided reflection. \u00b6 Briefly: \u2022 What did you make? And why did it matter? I tried to have interactions with people in the street, as first attempt because I found important to be relatable with people I is an effort to understand how to connect with people in different ways or levels. For me is more to develop a skill because at one point we have design with other and for others, and in order to do that, we as designers need to understand how to engage properly with people or communities in a horizontal and participatory level for having meaningful design outcomes \u2022 What happens when you involve yourself? For me 1pp I tried to understand it as an exercise for exploration of an idea, but in some point, because of the nature of my exploration, it became blurry at first the line between an exploration and an ethnography. \u2022 What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? Many things happen during the exercise, I tried to adapt myself and to have creative responses, but at the end everything flows perfectly when the interaction starts spontaneously. Another thing is that in some point of the interaction I became aware that I was in a roll of designer making an investigation of the subjects so I try to just relax and be a subject of experiences that was a meaningful interaction. In that point I stop to worried about the information or how I was going to present the exploration. At the end I accomplish the goal of my exploration which was to have a meaningful interaction. \u2022 Did anything change about your way of working? It changed a lot that day, in first place because at first I made an attempt to approach people but I think it was in some way disruptive and not pleasant for them to interrupt them, it doesn\u2019t matter if they were not doing anything and form it was not spontaneous from my side, I choose who to approach and how to start the conversation and also I was feeling insecure because I was having a little bit of a cold in those days. The second attempt was more easy because I identify a group of people which I know we have common interest or at least something in common. As a result, I got a meaningful interaction and the only thing that I had to do was to go there with them, spontaneously. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work? That if we try to design the social interaction most of the time we are going to have random outcomes, so in a way a design for social intervention could be designed for or with some degree of randomness and spontaneity. \u2022 After seeing the videos of your collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? I found amazing work of the collective, with a topic that could be explored in deeper or critical way such as the contextualization/decontextualization of the objects performed by Andrea, that approach could be used as tool for criticism, also the context/empathy exercise from Busy and Angel offers a good perspective of understanding the world could function if we are not the same person with the same qualities as we are now. Also I found very interesting the approaches of comparing or analyzing the products we use or how we as consumers waste. Everyone has a unique approach and, so far, I think they are interested in a grater good. watch the video","title":"Living with your own ideas...and others"},{"location":"seminars/04-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas_and%20others/#living-with-your-own-ideasand-others","text":"","title":"Living with your own ideas...and others"},{"location":"seminars/04-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas_and%20others/#the-empathy-machine","text":"At first it is baffling to try to understand the velocity of the seminars but I understand the valuable of building knowledge through the making of prototypes.

It changed a lot that day, in first place because at first I made an attempt to approach people but I think it was in some way disruptive and not pleasant for them to interrupt them, it doesn\u2019t matter if they were not doing anything and form it was not spontaneous from my side, I choose who to approach and how to start the conversation and also I was feeling insecure because I was having a little bit of a cold in those days. The second attempt was more easy because I identify a group of people which I know we have common interest or at least something in common. As a result, I got a meaningful interaction and the only thing that I had to do was to go there with them, spontaneously. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work? That if we try to design the social interaction most of the time we are going to have random outcomes, so in a way a design for social intervention could be designed for or with some degree of randomness and spontaneity. \u2022 After seeing the videos of your collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? I found amazing work of the collective, with a topic that could be explored in deeper or critical way such as the contextualization/decontextualization of the objects performed by Andrea, that approach could be used as tool for criticism, also the context/empathy exercise from Busy and Angel offers a good perspective of understanding the world could function if we are not the same person with the same qualities as we are now. Also I found very interesting the approaches of comparing or analyzing the products we use or how we as consumers waste. Everyone has a unique approach and, so far, I think they are interested in a grater good. watch the video","title":"Guided reflection."},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/","text":"Tech Beyond the Myth \u00b6 iMac Destructor \u00b6 Visit the link for the report iMac Destructor Insight \u00b6 The styling slavery \u00b6 Disassembling the iMac 2006 , was for me like a magician trick, the one in which he keeps pulling out infinite amount of handkerchiefs form his sleeve.

Maybe we can design objects in which the user has to be more involved from the \u201cbirth\u201d of the appliance, from selecting the material, the origin, the motherboards, the function that would perform and assembly it by himself, and keep it always updated and never obsolete.

Can I produce the ingredients of my meals at home or my neighborhood? hypothesis: I CAN PRODUCE THE INGREDIENTS OF MY MEALS AT HOME OR MY NEIGHBORHOOD. Tips \u00b6 We recommend that, in order to realize the experiment properly, we require to collect data during the year, because of the time of growth of the plants. Nutritional data is required to estimate possible species to grow, and therefore the space demanded for a person to grow his food. In addition, being aware that particles in the air and other gases might affect the correct development of plants. And, try to not be around the sensor while it is doing the measurement because it affect the results. From hypothesis to data \u00b6 Tools selection \u00b6 We chose the CITIZEN SENSING TOOLKIT http://making-sense.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Citizen-Sensing-A-Toolkit.pdf We selected it because we wanted to figure out how is the weather (temperature, humidity, light, eCO2, eVO2) in the possible free spots to grow food in the neighborhood and compare it to what the plants require to grow there. Tool usage documentation \u00b6 The process can be replicated using the same Citizen Sensing Toolkit , what we recommend is to do it at different times a day and in all the seasons if it is referred to growing plants. Check the outliers when you download the information. Data capturing strategy \u00b6 First, we choose the places that are already working as urban gardens, then we start thinking of possible places that might be used to check if they can be used to growing the food, and what types of food might be there. The data was taken from 14:30pm to 16:30pm in 7 places that we checked before start. Then we download the data in the laptop to start the cleaning of the information. Materials needed \u00b6 Smart citizen kit sensor USB cable Computer to configure the SCK Cell phone to connect the SCK using WiFi connection, and take pictures and videos to documentation. Detail setup instructions \u00b6 The first step is to connect the battery. The kit will light in red (configuration mode) Sign up to the Smart Citizen Platfom When the light is red, the CSK is ready to set up, either by WiFi or SD Card connection When the light is blue, the SCK is on Wi-Fi connection. In this way, the device will publish the data every minute on the smartcitizen.me platform When the SCK is pink, it is on offline mode and is saving the information on the SD Card When we measured, we pressed the button once until the light turnd pink, we measured for 10 minutes then switched it to standy turning the light red Find a good and clear location to place the Citizen Sensing Toolkit . If you need to measure light, make sure it is \u201cface up\u201d. Data collected \u00b6 Using the Smart citizen kit, we planned to visit 6 different locations to gather data on light quality, humidity, Temperature and particle matter.

To improve the data: - We would need to take measurements of all year and at the same time in different places. - In order to have an efficient use of the space for producing the plants, we would have to measure characteristics of the soil as well (nutrients, chemicals, ph, etc.) - Other parameters could be taken into account: available time of people to take care of it, space available. Raw data We used google sheet pivot tables to agregate data into averages by location and also to focus on specific parameters. Average of data by location Focus of each location data to remove potential outliers Comparision bubble chart x = temperature y = light diameter of the bubbles = CO2 particules We displayed the ideal location conditions needed for the 4 vegetables we studied above. Potatoes, carrots : not any location studied respond to the requirement of light needed Lettuce, tomatoes : only the rooftop of IAAC would allow us to grow these! We need to continue the research on the vegetables that we can grow in the winter season with very little light. Tips and biais \u00b6 We didn\u2019t pay attention to the noise sensor so we made some noise discussing just next to the sensor during the data capturing. It would be interesting to stay silent or go further during the recording so we can see how much frequentation there is in the different locations. Scale the process : To record more accurate and more comparable data, it would be better to record a full day and not just 10 minutes to know how much light the location gets. Here we just recorded 10 minutes in each spot and not at the same time of the day (between 1pm and 4:30pm).","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#imac-destructor","text":"Visit the link for the report iMac Destructor","title":"iMac Destructor"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#insight","text":"","title":"Insight"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#the-styling-slavery","text":"Disassembling the iMac 2006 , was for me like a magician trick, the one in which he keeps pulling out infinite amount of handkerchiefs form his sleeve.
