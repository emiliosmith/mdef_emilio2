In the case of the project of Compost Commune, we use the MicroChallenge III to design a sensor for humidity because in the research of the project we found that maintain certain temperature and humidity in the compost is essential for its production. With that in mind we start to explore the different sensors available for the soil and their applications with Arduino in order to find something that could be efficient and friendly for any user. As first step we choose different sensor and test them with different types of soil and we try to understand the values that appear in the serial monitor and understand it logic. We try different sensors and we find that is common to have low quality sensors with bad readings; as well that it is common to used incorrectly by not choosing the right voltage pin or declaring an analog or digital pin depending the type of sensor. After defining the correct use of the sensor we program the ESP to take the reading and transform it a percentage of humidity. The first challenge was to understand the lecture, because this kind of sensor measure the amount of current that travel between its nods; that means when the sensor has the most currents is when it is fully wet, when it has the lowest reading is when the soil is totally dry and the current doesn\u2019t travel easily. From this we have transform in the code the value of the sensor to a percentage of humidity in order to have some valuable input for the user. The final concept was to have the reading of the sensor available on a IP address in order to be accessible to every member of the community garden. This point I will explain it in the Week 14 . Prototype \u00b6 Because we wanted that the device was autonomous and no to rely on a computer in order to be functional, Edu recommend us to use a Lipo battery. We choose a LiPo battery of 1000mAh of 3.7V, which was the voltage needed for maintain the sensor operational. The 1000 mAh so far, it has last for about 3 hours of having a constant lecture. And it is rechargeable with the laptop trough the connection of the ESP. Pictures of the LiPo From this device I design the KiCad diagram in order to have a PCB and mount the ESP, have the connection with the sensor and the LiPo battery and to have it in an accessible case. After the Footprint ready, I design some branding as part of the project Compost Commune and to generate the PNG files needed for milling the PCB. The files needed to be prepared by outline, traces and holes all in PNG black and white with the same size and resolution (1000ppi). I am used to work in AI so I manage to work with the SVG format and have it one place in an different space to divide between outlines, traces and holes. AI allows you to export in PNG each artwork in any resolution. When the files are ready in PNG, as part of the Week 4, they were used for milling the PCB in the SRM Roland. For using this milling machine I have to use the modsproject.org page for access to the programs and generate the. rml files required. For this modules, we have to choose the correct SRM module and select between the 1/64 or 1/32 tool depending if it is a trace or a hole or outline. The speed, and the origin has to be defined as well. Link to modsproject After the .rml files are ready, they are charged in the interface of the milling machine. The first step is to choose the correct tool for the traces or the outline, then define and select the XY origin depending where the PCB is situated, and then the Z, which is more complex. Note, for the outline we have to be very careful of not doing it to close to the traces or to the exterior or the PCB, as well we have to take care of the size and the color depending in which image processor you use. After everything is situated we can start to mill. The tutorial page is this one After the PCB is ready we solder the components, in this case we only use male and female connector for the ESP and the sensor. The LiPo battery is connected directly to the ESP via port. When the components are soldered, I design a case in Rhino, with the final size of the components, and taking into account that in could be accessible for charging and replacing the sensor. The case was 3D printed in white PLA and the lid was laser cut in acrylic. Final pictures.

This point I will explain it in the Week 14 .","title":"Inputs and Outputs"},{"location":"FabAcademy/10-13%20week%2010-13%20FabAcademy/#prototype","text":"Because we wanted that the device was autonomous and no to rely on a computer in order to be functional, Edu recommend us to use a Lipo battery. We choose a LiPo battery of 1000mAh of 3.7V, which was the voltage needed for maintain the sensor operational. The 1000 mAh so far, it has last for about 3 hours of having a constant lecture. And it is rechargeable with the laptop trough the connection of the ESP. Pictures of the LiPo From this device I design the KiCad diagram in order to have a PCB and mount the ESP, have the connection with the sensor and the LiPo battery and to have it in an accessible case. After the Footprint ready, I design some branding as part of the project Compost Commune and to generate the PNG files needed for milling the PCB. The files needed to be prepared by outline, traces and holes all in PNG black and white with the same size and resolution (1000ppi). I am used to work in AI so I manage to work with the SVG format and have it one place in an different space to divide between outlines, traces and holes. AI allows you to export in PNG each artwork in any resolution. When the files are ready in PNG, as part of the Week 4, they were used for milling the PCB in the SRM Roland. For using this milling machine I have to use the modsproject.org page for access to the programs and generate the. rml files required. For this modules, we have to choose the correct SRM module and select between the 1/64 or 1/32 tool depending if it is a trace or a hole or outline. The speed, and the origin has to be defined as well. Link to modsproject After the .rml files are ready, they are charged in the interface of the milling machine. The first step is to choose the correct tool for the traces or the outline, then define and select the XY origin depending where the PCB is situated, and then the Z, which is more complex. Note, for the outline we have to be very careful of not doing it to close to the traces or to the exterior or the PCB, as well we have to take care of the size and the color depending in which image processor you use. After everything is situated we can start to mill. The tutorial page is this one After the PCB is ready we solder the components, in this case we only use male and female connector for the ESP and the sensor. The LiPo battery is connected directly to the ESP via port. When the components are soldered, I design a case in Rhino, with the final size of the components, and taking into account that in could be accessible for charging and replacing the sensor. The case was 3D printed in white PLA and the lid was laser cut in acrylic. Final pictures.

We try to have an ethical approach in order to have a democratic and empowering device through the easy access to information, and from that trigger some action between the member of the community. The general concept was to have a lecture or reading of the humidity of the compost through a sensor. The humidity in this case is important because heat and humidity are required to be controlled often in order to have a correct production of the compost. From the ethical perspective we sough that people get more involved in this process by knowing the status of the compost regardless the place they were, and by having this access to the information they could organize themselves and take action if it is needed. Therefore, people are more participatory and the task of taking care of the compost not rely in only one person.

Rei and Emilio were working on the compost intervention, so we easily came to this idea of making part of our intervention related to making a compost toolkit. First Jeremy was also in the group, but eventually separated to do the different things after talking about what we want to make for this challenge. Initial Idea \u00b6 When we started designing, we also had reviews from Guillem, Kate and alumni Pablo for the design intervention and that influenced us to work on this challenge as a prototype for intervention. Since we talked with them, we wanted to develop a compost toolkit sensor that detects some information about the status of the compost such as temperature, humidity, ph, etc.. We discussed focusing on the one feature now to understand how it can be interactive even without using electric sensors, but in an analog way. Gillem advised us to use thermochromic paint which can change its color with the temperature to see how warm the compost gets inside the box. Also to show that and what kind of food waste is thrown away is important because it can lead to the consciousness of waste. We decided to make a transparent compost box for food waste consiousness and making the composting process to be seen Design Process \u00b6 Based on this concept, we decided to build a transparent compost box that has two layers and also has thermochromic features. It is designed for a compost beginner that wants to see what is going on inside and wants to make sure the temperature which indicates the status of compost. 1.Sketch \u00b6 We first drew a sketch, like a really simple one with adding the features. We wanted this compost box with these following features. with a Lid to avoid the smell showing the process air can come in people can look what is inside people can put food waste sieving compost detect temperature change of the compost scaling how much compost decreased 2.Modeling \u00b6 We used Rhinoceros to model. We finalized the design by researching some references. Bio Compostera Digital This is how we finished up designing. As we knew Emilio would leave earlier, so we wanted to keep it simple for Rei to be able to manage everything. It has two layers. The top layer is for decomposing. The bottom layer is used for ready-to-use compost which is sieved from the top layer that has new food waste to decompose. It also dehydrates from the top parts to the bottom. Bottom part can also be used for the plant pot. This compost box can also be a demonstration or exhibition of making awareness of food waste to people because it has a hole on the top so people can look at it. Based on the modeling, we made a cutting data. We made the tolerance for + 0.3 mm. 3.Material \u00b6 Also we wanted to make it transparent to show the inside and the thermochromic color would turn transparent with the heat, so we decided to use acrylic. We actually wanted to use plywood for the back part of the box in order to paint, but there was no plywood that has the same thickness. -3mm Acrylic Board 600x1000mm -thermochromic paint -soil -foodwaste \u203bAll the following is documented by Rei 4. Laser Cutting \u00b6 I tested the joints with acrylic to see how much tolerance should. Then I got to know that it should be less than the thickness of the material because the laser burns it. So I changed the tolerance to -0.1mm. First the parameter was too weak, it did not cut through the board. Then changed the parameter keeping the same power but slower speed. Then it finally cut through. I did the preassembly to make sure if it all fits. It was fine so I then moved to the paint. 5. Paint \u00b6 I used thermochromic paint I bought to apply on the back part of the box. I painted with a brush,(it actually recommended airbrush or spray which I don\u2019t have) I put almost 5 layers by firstly applying the primer on the surface. I also did a test first. It turns transparent when it attaches to something that is 26-31 degrees. I dried it completely and now it is ready to assemble! 6. Assembly \u00b6 I assembled it using a rubber hammer to completely fit the joints. And I put some compost on the top layer. Some soil that is ready to use goes to the bottom . . Now it is ready to use! Learnings \u00b6 -When making cutting data, it is always important to test cut the joints first -When cutting with laser, it is always important to test cut with the parameter -Materials tend to vary the thickness even in the same piece of board -Acrylic is hard to assemble with finger joints that it sometimes cracks the edge -Designing parametrically is necessary for the joint design Next Step \u00b6 Now I placed it on the corner of our class room. So anyone can throw away their food waste from the hole on the lid and mix it with the shovel. It can be interactive as it changes the color on the back part which indicates how active this compost is because active compost increases temperature. I also want to give it to a compost begginer to test how these features can be effective for them to start doing a compose -these features make it easier? Interactive? Understandable? Fun? Based on the reflections to the test, I will develop a new version of a compost box. . .","title":"Micro Challenge  1 FabAcademy"},{"location":"FabAcademy/Micro%20Challenge%20I/#micro-challenge-1-fabacademy","text":"link to repository (https://github.com/emiliosmith/FabAcademy-challenge.git)","title":"Micro Challenge  1 FabAcademy"},{"location":"FabAcademy/Micro%20Challenge%20I/#micro-challenge-1","text":"","title":"Micro Challenge 1"},{"location":"FabAcademy/Micro%20Challenge%20I/#fabacademy-1st-challenge-feb15-18","text":"by Rei Terauchi & Emilio Smith","title":"FabAcademy 1st Challenge Feb.15-18*"},{"location":"FabAcademy/Micro%20Challenge%20I/#group","text":"We formed a group based on the design intervention.

Since we have been focusing on food waste and compost for the past design interventions, we have wanted to have another approach to it. Actually we were planning to design a hydroponic chair for this time, but when we came to think about the relation and continuation from our design intervention, we thought that we should keep focusing on the food waste topic. Probably we will work on the hydroponic chair another time. (Also we need to figure out arduino stuff to do it) Link to our project For the past few weeks, we have been trying to get engaged in the Poblenou local community, especially those of community gardens and local restaurants in order to make a small circulation in the area. We have been asking if we can get their food waste to make compost in local community gardens to local restaurants, and we have been asking if we can collaborate in making compost for local community gardens. \u00b6 . . Recently we have been in touch with this restaurant just across the street of IaaC called Galega, and the owner is so friendly. He gives us a lot of coffee waste and sometimes bread from the day before. Bread can be printed into something like a cookie we found in the article. We decided to 3D print it and exhibit it at the design dialogue as our different perspective/approach to the food waste and compost topic. Also to exhibit, we have decided to make a stand and a base for the exhibition to put the cookies on and also for the other stuff we have designed already. Additionally we also designed a push cart for carrying waste and soil from one place to another. Because when Galega gives us a big bag of coffee waste, it is super heavy and hard to carry. We both worked together, but Rei mainly focused on 3D printing cooking, Emilio mainly designed modeling for CNC. . Fabrication Process <3D PRINTING COOKIE> This time we used bread from Galega. We actually tried the test with pasta which Emilio found in his kitchen, probably from a long time ago. We first boiled the pasta with a bit of salt and smashed it with a blender into a dense paste. We tested with a cylinder if this paste is thick enough to extrude. Once the paste looked fine and tasted fine, we put it into the cylinder for the 3D printer. We tried the test printing with a small circle. .3w7AgmXdM15vgqxXv5PC1648207302-1648207390.gif . It was okay for the first time but as the paste got more dense as it dried out, it became much harder to extrude because it stuck in the extruder. . . Learning from this, we decided to make bread paste a little bit loose. . First we tried a circle and it went well for several layers. . After that we tried to make our own design of a cookie. . .Videotogif.gif .Videotogif2.gif Somehow there was something wrong with the code, the paste mixer of the 3D printer did not mix, we fixed it on grasshopper and it extruded constantly. . . . This is how cookies look and we tried some of them baked in the oven. Emilio tried it and said it is not bad. . . . We designed them from a sketch and into 3d modeling with Rhino, and cut them with CNC. It was our first time using CNC at IaaC. . . . . We designed several different things for the exhibition. One table, two stands, and one push cart. We made the data carefully by checking the tolerance and diameter of the pockets. . Problems For 3D printing -The paste of the food waste easily gets thicker so it gets stuck with the extruder. We added more water to manage it. -The mixer of a 3D printer stopped mixing the paste. We changed the code in grasshopper to manage it. -When we tried to print the complex design, the extruder squished the printed paste because it went over the same paths. We thought we needed to model the design that each path goes on the top of another so the extruder will not go on to the other path. -Printed paste dried but cracked easily, there needs to be something flexible for the recipe to make paste. . -Maybe normal shapes can be just made with a mold. For CNC -It is always hard to check the right tolerance before cutting. Also it should be faster to manage that by using grasshopper, we want to try that. Even If only one cutting data is wrong, we need to cut it again. -It takes super long time for engraving and cutting. Future Development We thought 3D printing food waste is capable of giving us a new perspective in dealing with food waste and compost. Usually wasted food doesn\u2019t look attractive at all so no one eats it, but when it is printed with a 3D printer, it looks attractive so people would eat it. It can be an interesting fact that people will think of food waste as something edible and also for waste consiousness. We want to try to make more complex shapes and a variety of food waste paste to develop this project. To do that, we want to make something that actually makes food waste printed taste good and develop a recipe for open source. We will keep in touch with neighbors as we try to get the food waste from them also using our push cart.","title":"Micro Challenge  II FabAcademy"},{"location":"FabAcademy/Micro%20Challenge%20II/#micro-challenge-ii-fabacademy","text":"link to repository (https://github.com/terauchi-rei/fabchallange2.git)","title":"Micro Challenge  II FabAcademy"},{"location":"FabAcademy/Micro%20Challenge%20II/#micro-challenge-iii","text":"","title":"Micro Challenge III"},{"location":"FabAcademy/Micro%20Challenge%20II/#fabacademy-1st-challenge-feb15-18","text":"by Rei Terauchi & Emilio Smith 2nd Fabacademy Challenge* Initial Ideas and Purpose This time we have decided to print local food waste in Poblenou to regenerate something edible.

After that we tried to make our own design of a cookie. . .Videotogif.gif .Videotogif2.gif Somehow there was something wrong with the code, the paste mixer of the 3D printer did not mix, we fixed it on grasshopper and it extruded constantly. . . . This is how cookies look and we tried some of them baked in the oven. Emilio tried it and said it is not bad. . . . We designed them from a sketch and into 3d modeling with Rhino, and cut them with CNC. It was our first time using CNC at IaaC. . . . . We designed several different things for the exhibition. One table, two stands, and one push cart. We made the data carefully by checking the tolerance and diameter of the pockets. . Problems For 3D printing -The paste of the food waste easily gets thicker so it gets stuck with the extruder. We added more water to manage it. -The mixer of a 3D printer stopped mixing the paste. We changed the code in grasshopper to manage it. -When we tried to print the complex design, the extruder squished the printed paste because it went over the same paths. We thought we needed to model the design that each path goes on the top of another so the extruder will not go on to the other path. -Printed paste dried but cracked easily, there needs to be something flexible for the recipe to make paste. . -Maybe normal shapes can be just made with a mold. For CNC -It is always hard to check the right tolerance before cutting. Also it should be faster to manage that by using grasshopper, we want to try that. Even If only one cutting data is wrong, we need to cut it again. -It takes super long time for engraving and cutting. Future Development We thought 3D printing food waste is capable of giving us a new perspective in dealing with food waste and compost. Usually wasted food doesn\u2019t look attractive at all so no one eats it, but when it is printed with a 3D printer, it looks attractive so people would eat it. It can be an interesting fact that people will think of food waste as something edible and also for waste consiousness. We want to try to make more complex shapes and a variety of food waste paste to develop this project. To do that, we want to make something that actually makes food waste printed taste good and develop a recipe for open source. We will keep in touch with neighbors as we try to get the food waste from them also using our push cart.","title":"Link to our project For the past few weeks, we have been trying to get engaged in the Poblenou local community, especially those of community gardens and local restaurants in order to make a small circulation in the area. We have been asking if we can get their food waste to make compost in local community gardens to local restaurants, and we have been asking if we can collaborate in making compost for local community gardens."},{"location":"FabAcademy/Micro%20Challenge%20III/","text":"Micro Challenge III FabAcademy \u00b6 link to repository (https://github.com/terauchi-rei/fabchallenge3.git) Micro Challenge III \u00b6 =============== by Rei Terauchi & Emilio Smith Objective \u00b6 How can we activate participation in a community Using data to encourage an activity that benefit all the members In a community based project, we have to encourage the participation of people, we have to design the inputs that motivate people to integrate and participate for the good of the community. When we talk about compost making, we are lacking inputs to know if we are doing well or not if we are not used to work with soil and plants. With that in mind, it is needed to design something that can give a lecture and create an output of information that could be available for a community and in that way activate the participation. We intend to use this concept to design an interaction between sensors that can be connected to the soil or the compost in order to connect to the people in the community and have a social action and integration in the task that benefits all.

It detects the humidity at every certain time that you control by arduino. First, we have this water pump kit that we wanted to use in order to automatically control the humidity of plants/compost. In theory, if we have this on, we will not let the plants die. We killed some plants when we left them over the holidays. We first planned to have this dream image. Somehow we wanted to pursue the way that we share collected data community wise since we are engaged in this community garden in Poblenou. Emilio tried hard to control this humidity sensor using an arduino IDE for the CPU we had of ESP32. So many problems happened through this process because the sensor gives the random numbers which indicate the voltage that sensor senses. So it was hard to convert them into the number of percentages. Also, the percentage was somehow backward of the actual number. So it was also hard to fix it how it is supposed to be. In the end, it is connected to the rechargeable battery to be on its own so it doesn\u2019t have to be connected to a computer. With a 3d printed case for both battery and the CPU, it can be embedded in the soil of plants/compost. While printing, Emilio worked on the Html to visualize the percentage in a nicer way to show information. !! It is still in the process.

We explain them about the compost, the pros a cons of doing it and the context of or Masters and how we wanted to build collaborative networks with other actors in the proximity. We have to wait for the political process in order to everyone be agree with it. After that process was to define the place, because despite our explanation, the members still have misconceptions about the compost, like smell, animals and past bad experiences. This process takes us almost 3 weeks and at the end the final decision was taken for the most interested member of the community. The final place in which the compost has to be located was crucial for the production and the design that we wanted to test. While the final location was defined we made a design process in order to know more about the organization, the motivation of each member, the time and resources that everyone can provide.

Commitment 2.- Generate an user manual, interface for the community use of the compost. Pending Derivate of the process they have been emerging different needs and enquires about how the compost is eventually going to integrate and regenerate the soil, so with that in mind we define another commitment: Commitment 3.- Prepare a guide and toolkit for testing the soil and comparing it with the compost, and evaluate the health of the soil by chemical, physical and biological testing. Pending Commitment 4.- Evaluation performance. Evaluate how well is working to make changes or adjustments, so in this part we are going to try the different sensor and empower people to use them and react from the data received. Pending Commitment 1 \u00b6 From the review with Jonathan and the information collected, we have the feedback of a design of a bin with certain features and we add another features that we wanted to explore for making more efficient, friendly and that allow the appropriation of the technique. We use a design based on different chambers for production, resting and maturing; and from the characteristics of the garden I wanted to explore the different ways of harvesting the solar heat in order to be more productive; with that in mind I design a lid that could help us to make different test and measure for the amount of temperature that the principal chamber have to reach creating a greenhouse effect.

I observed the design from my local context understanding that it exists an ontic reality, which is not necessarily what it is true but is there; this vision has been expanded and at the same time narrowed in my brief journey in the MDEF This reflection practice, represent for myself and exercise to have an understanding of the plausible in design in my context, for finding a truth by contrasting my beliefs and knowledge of what, I now understand that, I didn\u2019t was aware of. It is not my intention to have an ultimate truth or dictate any kind of practice. This exercise is more an intention to create an objective truth as possible could be, identifying the possible bias inherited in me by my context and my journey through my lifetime and hopefully this practice could work as a reference for anyone else. How much of what we believe is actually true? What we believe is right? This questions have to be a constant in our head, it has to be present in any creative process therefore in design practice. We love design by it potential for creating amazing artifacts and changes in our environment, but not every idea of every person has this goal. We have been taught inside a system in which we believe that we are unique, and our voice and point of view is exceptional therefore dominant and valid, derivate this by years of colonialism and capitalism exploitation, and that actions has been explained and in different ways and contexts, by different authors like Paulo Freire and Franz Fanon; this action of domination and imposition is mentioned by the EZLN and there is in design a movement based on a manifesto dedicated to eradicate colonialism from design practice (http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/editorial/). This background shapes from our personal live, through our professional life; we as designer believe that we have the ultimate decisions, that every detail, has to be dictated by us, under our supervision, and that has been a constant from many years and it is present in many fields, not just in design. Of course it exists examples in which a personal decision has to be crucial, due to their hyper specialization in an area like medical, engineering, etc. It is understood that there are specialists with particular knowledge or expertise that has to be consulted, integrated or followed. We have to be humble in order identify the necessities of the design process as well, understanding that sometimes specialist have to work under different paradigms, but in sake of a creative process, diversity has been proved to be more effective if it is part of a broader system, as well and identify our role, the role of others and ours grade of specialty. The design from my context, could be perceived and eventually understand as an action performed by humans through the movements of their body parts ignited by a cognitive or creative process with the end of transforming or interacting with their context. From an academic perspective, design could be represented by a creative process that shapes the historical materialism in an industrialized culture; but as well design could be a performative activity that could allow any person in any culture to express themselves through interaction with others, human or not human, including his or her context. The definition that I am used to, from college is the one from Fernando Martin Ju\u00e9z that states that design is inherent in any human begin and a reflection of its \u201ccapabilities\u201d or \u201ctalents\u201d. We use this activity to transform our world, and design is more a socio-cultural activity rather than a consumist activity. But as well design is used to define the action of designing an algorithm, a public policy or an automobile or a chirurgical tool. Design in the contemporary, from my belief, is an activity that is empowered by a variety of processes from the far technological to the far artistic specter, understanding that they are not mutually exclusive; is in that specter where design as practice nurture itself to have a bigger, broader, and deeper impact. Design is present in a process of shaping a stick with a rock for making a tool as well as designing a bridge in parametric software and 3D printing it with a machine. How can design help you to achieve your purpose? \u00b6 From my time in the MDEF, I have understood that, we as a designer we have to be aware that we live in a hyper connected world, that any idea that we thing that is original or unique probably some already have done something alike in other part of the world, well documented and shareable. Is in this context that having a broader perspective of what exist outside of our context, and be open to every resource available and approachable. Open source technology, decentralized services could empower any people to star embodying the change by themselves and don\u2019t have to relay in other people to star. In the design practice we must relay in other people to grow as persons and to nourish any creative process to have a bigger impact and influence. We have to understand at this point that true change has to happen outside the capitalism paradigm and for that we have to understand what words like growth, consumption, production\u201d means in the context of our practice or what means with the people involved. Is with this in mind that design as business as usual has to disappear; design firms, design brands often keep empowering the same paradigm; from the big, white design office being a space alienates us from other realities, and the methodologies that reduce each complex individuals to consumers, users or stakeholders; with an environment to which we don\u2019t want to harm. Biting The Hand That Feeds \u00b6 From my beliefs, we have been thought that our name our vision has a value, and from art we tent to adore the big masters, big firms which mainly are men. With that in mind we try to print in our interventions our will to prevail through time, aspiring to be recognized in posterity. I believed that this conscious or unconscious agenda is part of the problem so far, by problem I mean prevailing the same dominant system. We tent to make artifacts that last and that will speak for us through the years. In a current scenario, how many things have been created? how many resources have been used? How many co-creation process have been poisoned by our ego? Design has to be \u201cegoless\u201d, we don\u2019t have to put our image our personal brand or our company brand in order no feel relevant in the history. That has to be the less important for shift to other paradigms. The mindset of the permanence of the ego respond to the canons of authorship present in the private property for exploitation. In contrast, for many years, different craftsmanship from indigenous communities are often seen as a collective effort for communicate their cosmovision and satisfy their self-consumption accordingly with what they have in their environment. The images, meanings, drawings, materials and patterns are part of their identity and the environment, and define them as a collective. Globalization, a symptom of capitalism is used for designers as a curtain to homologize our design all around the world, we used as a pretext conscious or unconsciously because we want to be part of a global esthetics, a part of global movement and to be recognized globally, as an example Fast Fashion. In a design practice this led us to decontextualize our design using materials, process that eventually are going to create an artifact that doesn\u2019t belong to its local ecosystem and with an aspirational aesthetic, to be globally accepted. There are many examples of a positive practice that talks about using the hyperlocal resources to create anything from textiles to social innovations. In M\u00e9xico there are exceptional projects in which through the craftsmanship from indigenous groups, artifacts are created under new paradigms. They required tremendous energy to keep using ancient techniques and create new social interactions around the project. A project I enjoy is F\u00e1brica Social (https://fabricasocial.mx/) which works with indigenous women from the south of M\u00e9xico for creating garments that reflect their culture honoring their cosmovision, this project is a fusion between designers and people from an horizontal and participatory perspective. Another approach that aided this framework is the Lo-TEK, concept coined by Julia Watson mostly for architectural design, in which the materiality is crafted from the local knowledge and linked deeply to their environment I have read many times the use of the word \u201cvernacular\u201d for describing similar practices, which I find it as an example of the aesthetics of the colonialism. The meaning of vernacular is used to describe something that is native from a specific place, but is used to describe something that is placed outside of our context, in that way we differentiate our intervention in other people\u2019s context in a colonialism approach. The language transform and we as designers can start by naming the thing are they are, we can start using word as they are named from the local and If we collaborate, co create or design for/with. Projects that part from the local are around the world with good and bad practices as well, but are the less if we comparing with all the needs we have under the capitalism paradigm ways of living, and it doesn\u2019t cover our all specter of necessities and must of them are created inside of the capitalism system in which the rules of the free market are still an ultimate decisive factors, like price and placement. Having that in mind there lays an opportunity to co-design, to co-create another system that allow us to change drastically for a better life, in which humans as are important as any other living organism, and that is design with the eco.

I observed the design from my local context understanding that it exists an ontic reality, which is not necessarily what it is true but is there; this vision has been expanded and at the same time narrowed in my brief journey in the MDEF This reflection practice, represent for myself and exercise to have an understanding of the plausible in design in my context, for finding a truth by contrasting my beliefs and knowledge of what, I now understand that, I didn\u2019t was aware of. It is not my intention to have an ultimate truth or dictate any kind of practice. This exercise is more an intention to create an objective truth as possible could be, identifying the possible bias inherited in me by my context and my journey through my lifetime and hopefully this practice could work as a reference for anyone else. How much of what we believe is actually true? What we believe is right? This questions have to be a constant in our head, it has to be present in any creative process therefore in design practice. We love design by it potential for creating amazing artifacts and changes in our environment, but not every idea of every person has this goal. We have been taught inside a system in which we believe that we are unique, and our voice and point of view is exceptional therefore dominant and valid, derivate this by years of colonialism and capitalism exploitation, and that actions has been explained and in different ways and contexts, by different authors like Paulo Freire and Franz Fanon; this action of domination and imposition is mentioned by the EZLN and there is in design a movement based on a manifesto dedicated to eradicate colonialism from design practice (http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/editorial/). This background shapes from our personal live, through our professional life; we as designer believe that we have the ultimate decisions, that every detail, has to be dictated by us, under our supervision, and that has been a constant from many years and it is present in many fields, not just in design. Of course it exists examples in which a personal decision has to be crucial, due to their hyper specialization in an area like medical, engineering, etc. It is understood that there are specialists with particular knowledge or expertise that has to be consulted, integrated or followed. We have to be humble in order identify the necessities of the design process as well, understanding that sometimes specialist have to work under different paradigms, but in sake of a creative process, diversity has been proved to be more effective if it is part of a broader system, as well and identify our role, the role of others and ours grade of specialty. The design from my context, could be perceived and eventually understand as an action performed by humans through the movements of their body parts ignited by a cognitive or creative process with the end of transforming or interacting with their context. From an academic perspective, design could be represented by a creative process that shapes the historical materialism in an industrialized culture; but as well design could be a performative activity that could allow any person in any culture to express themselves through interaction with others, human or not human, including his or her context. The definition that I am used to, from college is the one from Fernando Martin Ju\u00e9z that states that design is inherent in any human begin and a reflection of its \u201ccapabilities\u201d or \u201ctalents\u201d. We use this activity to transform our world, and design is more a socio-cultural activity rather than a consumist activity. But as well design is used to define the action of designing an algorithm, a public policy or an automobile or a chirurgical tool. Design in the contemporary, from my belief, is an activity that is empowered by a variety of processes from the far technological to the far artistic specter, understanding that they are not mutually exclusive; is in that specter where design as practice nurture itself to have a bigger, broader, and deeper impact. Design is present in a process of shaping a stick with a rock for making a tool as well as designing a bridge in parametric software and 3D printing it with a machine.","title":"Beliefs and knowledge about what design means to me."},{"location":"Paper%20Making%20Sense/Final%20Paper/#how-can-design-help-you-to-achieve-your-purpose","text":"From my time in the MDEF, I have understood that, we as a designer we have to be aware that we live in a hyper connected world, that any idea that we thing that is original or unique probably some already have done something alike in other part of the world, well documented and shareable. Is in this context that having a broader perspective of what exist outside of our context, and be open to every resource available and approachable. Open source technology, decentralized services could empower any people to star embodying the change by themselves and don\u2019t have to relay in other people to star. In the design practice we must relay in other people to grow as persons and to nourish any creative process to have a bigger impact and influence. We have to understand at this point that true change has to happen outside the capitalism paradigm and for that we have to understand what words like growth, consumption, production\u201d means in the context of our practice or what means with the people involved. Is with this in mind that design as business as usual has to disappear; design firms, design brands often keep empowering the same paradigm; from the big, white design office being a space alienates us from other realities, and the methodologies that reduce each complex individuals to consumers, users or stakeholders; with an environment to which we don\u2019t want to harm.","title":"How can design help you to achieve your purpose?"},{"location":"Paper%20Making%20Sense/Final%20Paper/#biting-the-hand-that-feeds","text":"From my beliefs, we have been thought that our name our vision has a value, and from art we tent to adore the big masters, big firms which mainly are men. With that in mind we try to print in our interventions our will to prevail through time, aspiring to be recognized in posterity. I believed that this conscious or unconscious agenda is part of the problem so far, by problem I mean prevailing the same dominant system. We tent to make artifacts that last and that will speak for us through the years. In a current scenario, how many things have been created? how many resources have been used? How many co-creation process have been poisoned by our ego? Design has to be \u201cegoless\u201d, we don\u2019t have to put our image our personal brand or our company brand in order no feel relevant in the history. That has to be the less important for shift to other paradigms. The mindset of the permanence of the ego respond to the canons of authorship present in the private property for exploitation. In contrast, for many years, different craftsmanship from indigenous communities are often seen as a collective effort for communicate their cosmovision and satisfy their self-consumption accordingly with what they have in their environment. The images, meanings, drawings, materials and patterns are part of their identity and the environment, and define them as a collective. Globalization, a symptom of capitalism is used for designers as a curtain to homologize our design all around the world, we used as a pretext conscious or unconsciously because we want to be part of a global esthetics, a part of global movement and to be recognized globally, as an example Fast Fashion. In a design practice this led us to decontextualize our design using materials, process that eventually are going to create an artifact that doesn\u2019t belong to its local ecosystem and with an aspirational aesthetic, to be globally accepted. There are many examples of a positive practice that talks about using the hyperlocal resources to create anything from textiles to social innovations. In M\u00e9xico there are exceptional projects in which through the craftsmanship from indigenous groups, artifacts are created under new paradigms. They required tremendous energy to keep using ancient techniques and create new social interactions around the project. A project I enjoy is F\u00e1brica Social (https://fabricasocial.mx/) which works with indigenous women from the south of M\u00e9xico for creating garments that reflect their culture honoring their cosmovision, this project is a fusion between designers and people from an horizontal and participatory perspective. Another approach that aided this framework is the Lo-TEK, concept coined by Julia Watson mostly for architectural design, in which the materiality is crafted from the local knowledge and linked deeply to their environment I have read many times the use of the word \u201cvernacular\u201d for describing similar practices, which I find it as an example of the aesthetics of the colonialism. The meaning of vernacular is used to describe something that is native from a specific place, but is used to describe something that is placed outside of our context, in that way we differentiate our intervention in other people\u2019s context in a colonialism approach. The language transform and we as designers can start by naming the thing are they are, we can start using word as they are named from the local and If we collaborate, co create or design for/with. Projects that part from the local are around the world with good and bad practices as well, but are the less if we comparing with all the needs we have under the capitalism paradigm ways of living, and it doesn\u2019t cover our all specter of necessities and must of them are created inside of the capitalism system in which the rules of the free market are still an ultimate decisive factors, like price and placement. Having that in mind there lays an opportunity to co-design, to co-create another system that allow us to change drastically for a better life, in which humans as are important as any other living organism, and that is design with the eco.

New models based on a distributed network like block chain could be an example of how could we start to migrate to a new paradigm, maybe not the best option or it is not proved enough, but it is worth to try it. Understanding how protocols works in the interconnectedness and the difference with platforms was the hardest part but is the first step to recognize the accountability in the use of our data and our freedom. Ourselves as users we neglect the externalities in the internet for many reason, because the lack of understanding of because we only want to have the good, without the bad. During this seminar we have a broader understanding of what really mean the use the internet by knowing the concept of Web 2.0, 3.0 and the respective vision in which these concepts are based on. Blockchain is part of a decentralize vision of a system, which is horizontal, bottom up and validated by other, totally opposed to the current monetary system which it\u00b4s only valid by few global institutions, a centralized system. As part of these decentralized efforts is the bitcoin and others types of cryptocurrency which allow the users to have a way to sustain or profit without the validation of a regulatory authority like a bank. This kind of exchange can be a starting point for jump into some different economic paradigms, away of conventionalism that keep profit by our labor. In the seminar we saw the example of a different model based this structure, Akasha and its different hubs are an example of organizations that rely in this technology and truly believe in doing thing differently. This are models that encourage and motivate other to imagine a different paradigm for organizations. For me it is a challenge to have a deeper understanding how this technology works and how as user could be part of this, if it not a final destination, at least would be a way to make a transition to a different model, a statement to other people that can\u00b4t see how capitalism could end.","title":"Collective Intelligence"},{"location":"Seminars%202%20Term/05-Future%20Talks/","text":"Future Talks \u00b6 Audrey Desjardines. \u00b6 First Person Perspective, Autoethnography \u00b6 This lecture was from Audrey Desjardines. She gave us a perspective from the design research process that she has been carry on. It was a good opportunity to understand and to know different approaches for the design process. She explains briefly the differences between First Person Perspective, Auto ethnography and that practices are more common in the social science; from the examples that Audrey use, for me was clearer the difference between this approaches and the research process in a linear process or conventional, like the one developed by IDEO. This method for research present different challenges, from the documentations methods to the perspective or bias of the researcher, but at the same time is a good way to make a project richer. As a designer and researcher to maintain a broader approach in the process eventually is going to lead you to a variety of insights, questions, results and interpretations that hardly could have been obtained by other methods. It allows you to have discussions, and is a way to learn by doing in the process, to embodied the solution with the knowledge that you as a researcher are going to gain in that process. Certainly is a different approach from a conventional design school of what I am used to, but whit out a doubt despite the barriers is an opportunity to let the solution emerge by itself without pushing it by a commercial agenda. Sergio Urue\u00f1a \u00b6 Responsive Innovation \u00b6 Be responsible and with a political notion and use it for framework the innovation within a design project. How can we shape better society with better technology, but by who and with whom? With Sergio we review different examples of how science, technology and innovations have shaped our world and have change our social dynamics, but at the same time help us to shape the future in a way of how we imagine the science and technologies breakthrough mostly a technological determinism as a counter part of social constructivism; at the end we have to realize that in time the hybridize, shaping each other. At the center of this materialism are as well designers, therefore we have to understand the responsibility in this process. In other hand is fundamental to understand the relationship between society, technology and innovation and how it interaction is framed also by institutions and governments in order to push an agenda. The socio-technical approach allows us to understand the many relationships between the STI and the many layers in society. Accountability and access are a strong issue in STI because in many places are used or neglected by a dominant group, it is our duty to realize that our efforts have to dismantle this and work for a more accessible and horizontal dynamics in society. Sergio as well present us a framework for RRI responsabilization, with 4 basic dimensions: Inclusions, Reflexivity, Responsiveness and Anticipation. To recognize which system, actors, and futures are we empowering through our projects in a real context, where the final people can engage with it. During the different terms, in the project, we have been detailing the people involve, and how we are going to present the information of the project, and eventually is shaping the design intervention, transforming and nourishing the ultimate design deliverable. This design deliverable at the end will be shaped by the participation of the people that we worked through the different design interventions. With our project of compost commune we noticed that the users could be very broad and diverse due to how well we can co-design a network between them. Another mindset that prevail during this process was the scalability of the network but thinking that can happen without our intervention, that in some point the people will engage in the practice of regeneration and will appropriate all the knowledge and making a strong community, having impact in different level of the socio political sphere. Laura Forlano \u00b6 Auto-ethnography \u00b6 The talk from Laura Forlano, was an opportunity to have another perspective for the First Person Perspective due her research. She spoke from the research approach in design, from the point of view of her as a subject, as a user that experiment certain condition and from that design the experience around it. Her perspective was about experiment with emergent technologies and how they could be embodied from the first person perspective Autoethnography and interaction with technology how it is part of her daily life, using of the system based in an algorithm that regulate the sugar in the blood, from that open the discussion about the relationships that the user has to create with the technology, how this could be hacked for be simpler or friendly to a particular lifestyle or condition. The user is more about understanding the user experience in a post-humanism or transhumanism perspective, expanding this definition by our relationship inside a socio technical system. From her research through the auto ethnography Laura remarks the importance of that acquired experience in order to have something that resonate in others; it is important to reflect from the own experience and share with other people and build networks and communities. Sa\u00fal Baeza \u00b6 Radical experimentation in design research \u00b6 Visit Hospitalet creative district. \u00b6 We can have a deep understanding of his practice and approach, and how he imprints a narrative that could transmit different reactions through common objects, reactions that are not commonly associated to them. It is important to remark how experimentation and practice is necessary in the exploration process. This materiality approach could lead us as designer to speculate with our design interventions how people could behavior differently around an artifact, context or thecnology, and offer a radical interaction. In the process of Sa\u00fal, we can appreciate the embodiment of the experimentation; how he is the first subject to be submerged in the concept and start the journey of living with it and learning Saul\u2019s process is something similar to the process of Laura or Audrey, a different approach to First Person Perspective but framed for having a narrative in an object or a space. Eventually these iterations are used to learn as well but at the end only a few iterations are selected as representative artifacts of the concept. In his process we can appreciate the value of reflecting in each step and try to have a deep understanding of the many relationships in an idea or concept, allowing to have a broader opportunity for the exploration. Finally, we could appreciate how a studio focus in this process could work and what relationships have to be formed for function without compromising the creative process or the vision of the exploration. Ron Wakkary \u00b6 Design with other and constituency in design. \u00b6 In this talk we have the opportunity to listen to Ron Wakkary and to explore how the role of the designer is expanded to it context, to affect every being. For these is needed the understanding of the different tools, approaches and experience in order to have a design respond for the emergent future. The \u201cdesign with\u201d is the actions of designing things for not only for humans, we have to understand where our intervention is going to be situated in which context, and that we are going to co-habit this context with it and others biological being that eventually are going to participate in the process or in the life span. The concept of biography that Ron uses, means that how our role as designers leave a trace and build interconnections between us, the design and the ecosystem or context; thinking in those terms allow or practice to be situated inside a richer world, full of entities for co-design with. At the same time, the biography of an artifact or of us, as designers, brings to the light the accountability of what is going to exist in the material world, co-habiting in ecosystem with other species. For example, the biography of the plastic bag tells us the history of how from a basic need for comfort pushed in the past, nowadays is shaping our world, co-habiting with us many, many years later after it main purpose was fulfill. Ron explain the concept of \u201cdesign with\u201d as a gathering, in which the process began as biography of the central concept or idea which at the moment of be materialized it will gather other being that exist in any given context; if we understand this moment as a gathering, we can broad our practice to a co-design or design with this others beings, co-designing and forming a sustainable relationship; be tuned with the surroundings. Ron launch a series of questions to think around our projects \u201cthink of your project as a biography, what humans and nonhumans does It gather?\u201d \u201cOf those that gather, which one joined later or were not planned to be part of the biography at first?\u201d With this mind, our companion compost, gather different biological species, from flies, to insects, and eventually if it used for growing food it could gather animals as seagulls, which in Barcelona are well known for picking anything to eat and of course rats; there is many information about how different biological species gather around the compost. One statement that can illustrate he co-design process that Ron used, was that we don\u2019t need to make nature better, nature by itself is perfect, therefore, we have to design for co-habit, in a way that our relationship would be in perfect harmony with the ecosystem. To define the constituency as designers, we have to understand that the concept refers to the agency created in our interventions. The politics that surround our biographies or the biographies of our things that we design. The constituency gathers all the actors and participants that going to co-design with us, human and non-human; this momentum allows that many biographies assembly themselves to create an interconnectedness and it is discussed the political agreements, designing in that moment the future impact in said interconnection and creating new interconnections. Other questions where launched, from this Ron asked us: What is the constituency that your biography is part of? What does it include and what is your role as the speaking subject a part of the constituency? Reflecting in the question I must said that the constituency in a regeneration project as working with the food waste for creating the conditions for growing more, is a moment that gather an environmental conditions that have been present in any natural system but is mainly driven by the will of the people involved because it is necessary start in a conscious way that circular systems have to be created and the concept of waste, it doesn\u2019t exist in nature; everything is a nutrient for other being.","title":"Future Talks"},{"location":"Seminars%202%20Term/05-Future%20Talks/#future-talks","text":"","title":"Future Talks"},{"location":"Seminars%202%20Term/05-Future%20Talks/#audrey-desjardines","text":"","title":"Audrey Desjardines."},{"location":"Seminars%202%20Term/05-Future%20Talks/#first-person-perspective-autoethnography","text":"This lecture was from Audrey Desjardines.

We tried to developed a practice around the compost making, in order to empower a regenerative activity that allowed people to have a healthy soil for growing their own food from their organic waste. A constant concept around the development of the design process was to create new habits and change behaviors in people around the organic waste. The first approaches to this was to create a recipient for the organic waste aiming to create a symbiosis relationship in which we try to explore and make explicit the moral agenda about the personal organic waste a how important is to process it correctly in a circular approach. Companion Compost \u00b6 This first approach was conducted in first instance for people as individuals in their own personal space or household. At this point we sought an open discussion and critique about the personal habits around the organic waste; by a brief analysis of it we intent to create consciousness about different environmental problems and use that as a drive or motivation for the change in the behavior. In the other hand for the container we encourage the users to create an identity and personalization of the container in order to create a bound in which two species have to cooperate for the sustainment. First Insights. \u00b6 Some of the insights of this first approach turns around to a moral objective in people which is to do good thing for the environment, to have an environmental consciousness and use it as motivation focused in an artifact for shaping behaviors. We find having an artifact with the characteristics of a living being very appealing to create a bound that works in different level, not just for an activity of waste management but also an interdependence. Analyzing different projects about compost we determine that approach could add another dimension to the activity because most of the commercial compost bins are very similar to a trash can, and as well a cardboard a pallet, even a hole in the ground could be used for making compost. There is not much reference of common artifact related for making compost. It\u2019s true that exist in the market different alternatives for making compost, from the containers made in clay to ones made with recycled plastic but of the lack of an identity this artifacts end looking like pots, trashcans, containers or something for gardening. In this case the agency for an environmental activity was driven by the object and the bound formed with the user. Other insight obtained in this stage was related to the information available for making the compost. It exists in many websites and literature different techniques and approaches to it. From the approach of the production in scale for farming to the waste management in the soil, although all have the same goal, the objective is different. In contrast with other type of technology or open source information, compost making is an activity that could be learned but in order to function has to be appropriated by experimentation; it is not the same to the same making compost for an industrial kitchen in the beach to a community garden in the mountain or in small flat in Barcelona. Fortunately, we didn\u2019t find any Intellectual Property or black boxes around the technology necessary for making compost, almost everything is open and available in books and websites and it could be easily adopted and must companies that commercialize compost bins offer information a capacitation as a strategy for encourage people to make compost. About the food waste \u00b6 One topic that we have in mind in the conversations, is about the food waste, because we didn\u2019t want to encourage people to use food that strictly is not good for people, and furthermore we sought to develop alternatives for use organic waste for make bio materials for fabricate tools that could be used in the task for work with the compost. We have in mind since the beginning that the objective was to avoid organic waste and we wanted to avoid that people generate more organic waste just for feed the companion compost; that especially when our design interventions where performed for children. Black boxes in the networks. \u00b6 For the second interventions we interviewed different actors around the compost because we sought to escalate the impact of the project. In this research we found different approaches for this activity, one of them was an initiative in Madrid in where the neighbors in a block organize themselves in order to make a community compost. In the interview with them, they were very open about their process of organization and the political structure that have to follow in order to function, the relationships with different actors and their motivations and the approach which mainly is an environmental consciousness. In contrast with another interview, we have the opportunity of listen a person with a more commercial approach; this interview showed us another perspective in which the motivation of environmental consciousness is linked to a commercial activity. We understand the compost making activity from a perspective of a company that search an income from it, and how the value chains are fundamental. From this perspective we question and reframe the purpose of our project; for us represent a paradox to pursue a regenerative practice with the environment and the community but at the same time search an economical income, although it is necessary for the operations eventually that lead to privatize certain information or process from the community, creating black boxes. For us it is more important to create an activity within the community and design what is necessary for the people to appropriate the technology and the value chain. Our goal change to design an interrelationship inside a community to have a regenerative practices empowered by the compost making. Regenerative Communities \u00b6 At this time in our project we are designing our intervention as a part of a community. For this intervention we find a community garden nearby IAAC, as an approach of the concept of design for the proximity detailed by Ezio Manzini. In this intervention we approached to them under an approach of a participatory design asking them first the pertinence of the design intervention and in the process learning more about the internal government and their structure in order to have a design that is centered in them, in their context; that can allow us to have a sustainable intervention that could be appropriated and not discarded eventually. We sought that the pertinence of the designed was based on the necessity of regenerate the soil for the plots of the garden as well to keep it healthy and avoid any commercial fertilizers or soils. We centered the participatory activity in the making of a compost bin which operates with a special feature, determining the habits and the activity around it. The design of the compost bin it is normative, it shows what thing have to be done, invite to create new discussions about what they have been using, what is good or bad for the plots. The design is moralizing explicitly for changing habits for regenerative practices. A strategy by design for it was to reuse a transform discarded pallets founded in the street, making a statement of the importance of a management of waste in a circular approach, having the moral benefits of having a less environmental impact in ones live. After analyzing this strategy could be a principle for the member of the community garden for using discarded material for other purposes including the creation of new spaces for making compost. At this point of the project, it calls my attention a conflict that emerges in this design, is around the features of the compost bin; this design was shared with us by one of our professor but the design was taken for a company in New Zealand that commercialize one compost bin similar but fabricated in rotational molding plastic. Although the design doesn\u2019t appear as patented or protected and it is not open source. Furthermore, we are not using the design for commercial purposes but for sure we are going to share the process and the information with people outside the community. From now on \u00b6 Eventually we sought as our final goal that we want to pursue as next actions in the next design interventions are that the technology or the process could be appropriated and transmitted in order to create new habits a practices that led to a regeneration of the soil; that people can be empowered by practicing and applying the knowledge around compost that could be found in the internet or in another media independently of what they can learn from us. Some comments that we consider as good signal about this, is hear from people that haven\u2019t made compost before have found motivation to start doing it.","title":"Design Ethics"},{"location":"Seminars%203%20term/Design%20Ethics/#design-ethics","text":"","title":"Design Ethics"},{"location":"Seminars%203%20term/Design%20Ethics/#perspectives-of-regenerative-practices-in-a-community-compost","text":"","title":"Perspectives of regenerative practices in a community compost."},{"location":"Seminars%203%20term/Design%20Ethics/#compost-commune","text":"Compost Commune is a project that born form different concepts and perspectives.

Fortunately, we didn\u2019t find any Intellectual Property or black boxes around the technology necessary for making compost, almost everything is open and available in books and websites and it could be easily adopted and must companies that commercialize compost bins offer information a capacitation as a strategy for encourage people to make compost.","title":"First Insights."},{"location":"Seminars%203%20term/Design%20Ethics/#about-the-food-waste","text":"One topic that we have in mind in the conversations, is about the food waste, because we didn\u2019t want to encourage people to use food that strictly is not good for people, and furthermore we sought to develop alternatives for use organic waste for make bio materials for fabricate tools that could be used in the task for work with the compost.

In this research we found different approaches for this activity, one of them was an initiative in Madrid in where the neighbors in a block organize themselves in order to make a community compost. In the interview with them, they were very open about their process of organization and the political structure that have to follow in order to function, the relationships with different actors and their motivations and the approach which mainly is an environmental consciousness. In contrast with another interview, we have the opportunity of listen a person with a more commercial approach; this interview showed us another perspective in which the motivation of environmental consciousness is linked to a commercial activity. We understand the compost making activity from a perspective of a company that search an income from it, and how the value chains are fundamental. From this perspective we question and reframe the purpose of our project; for us represent a paradox to pursue a regenerative practice with the environment and the community but at the same time search an economical income, although it is necessary for the operations eventually that lead to privatize certain information or process from the community, creating black boxes. For us it is more important to create an activity within the community and design what is necessary for the people to appropriate the technology and the value chain. Our goal change to design an interrelationship inside a community to have a regenerative practices empowered by the compost making.","title":"Black boxes in the networks."},{"location":"Seminars%203%20term/Design%20Ethics/#regenerative-communities","text":"At this time in our project we are designing our intervention as a part of a community. For this intervention we find a community garden nearby IAAC, as an approach of the concept of design for the proximity detailed by Ezio Manzini. In this intervention we approached to them under an approach of a participatory design asking them first the pertinence of the design intervention and in the process learning more about the internal government and their structure in order to have a design that is centered in them, in their context; that can allow us to have a sustainable intervention that could be appropriated and not discarded eventually. We sought that the pertinence of the designed was based on the necessity of regenerate the soil for the plots of the garden as well to keep it healthy and avoid any commercial fertilizers or soils. We centered the participatory activity in the making of a compost bin which operates with a special feature, determining the habits and the activity around it. The design of the compost bin it is normative, it shows what thing have to be done, invite to create new discussions about what they have been using, what is good or bad for the plots. The design is moralizing explicitly for changing habits for regenerative practices. A strategy by design for it was to reuse a transform discarded pallets founded in the street, making a statement of the importance of a management of waste in a circular approach, having the moral benefits of having a less environmental impact in ones live. After analyzing this strategy could be a principle for the member of the community garden for using discarded material for other purposes including the creation of new spaces for making compost. At this point of the project, it calls my attention a conflict that emerges in this design, is around the features of the compost bin; this design was shared with us by one of our professor but the design was taken for a company in New Zealand that commercialize one compost bin similar but fabricated in rotational molding plastic. Although the design doesn\u2019t appear as patented or protected and it is not open source.

It is unfair that environmental activist has to put their own live at risk for protect any kind of species or just their territory, like Berta Caceres an environmental activist that was murderer in her house There are some many examples of communities that lives almost free of needs of capitalism, like the Zapatistas. They have been told to people many times that we have to fight in our own territories with our own tools, so that\u00b4s why my fight starts with design. My fight as a designer is to improve the design solutions with new knowledge, working with people and be responsible and proactive about the social and environmental impact. My proffesional identity From the meetings Be more structured in order to communicate and organize better the information or the goals of a project or intervention, for some people it is better to understand a chart or an infographic rather than a bullet presentation Be more enthusiastic, first impression never forgets, with that in mind in order to work with groups of people, it will be important to engage with them since the beginning. Colorful, not everything is white and black , and broad or holistic, not everything it can be done from the design point of view, in some occasions a designer has to take a step back mostly in cooperative project. Personal development I have worked in the past year as a designer responsible of develop may kind of projects, but hardly those projects leave space to experiment or try another knowledge or discipline, for me is important at first instance to communicate an idea effectively and to engage passionately and effective to a group of people or community because always a design solution has to be involve in a network. For me it is important to have a broad understanding of all new knowledge and or technologies in order to push the envelope and go forward in the design process, because that knowledge is a medium to potentiate the design solution. Furthermore, I will search to engage with several disciplines in order to have a vast point of views, always having in mind that the people that have the problem is always the ones that can have the solution.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars%201%20Term/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars%201%20Term/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 Choosing weak signals At first instance it was very difficult just to choose one, even two cards, because each card at some point represent a interesting topic full of possibilities. It is hard from an industrial designer point of view, not to be triggered by each card and to jump immediately to a design intervention. To many possibilities at the beginning just play with your head in a bad way, tearing your efforts in so many directions, and in a co-depending, apprehensive exercise, one starts to making a Frank-enstein of a design solution as an excuse to use at least 5 cards. While we were hiking uphill, I was searching in my old bag of ideas for one that fits this Franken-stein solution but as we arrive at the top and we start to listen to Xavi, it hit me. I doesn\u2019t matter if I have to use the card for one signal or another, because at the end I want my fight to address the environmental issue, it doesn\u2019t matter at what level or from what perspective, it going to land there. At the top, the first task was achieved, I had selected Climate Conscience. What I understand about the card is environmental issues as the Climate and its crisis, they are very broad and maybe technical in some points because it is transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary, if we keep the subject in a certain level of conciseness maybe we can be more effective, maybe we can design interventions like acupuncture just to work exactly at one point to unchain the reac-tion that we want. The other agenda that I was thinking on, appear to me as Xavi was talking about the change in the use of the land in Vall\u00e9s county, this agenda is the one that has to address to a shift in the eco-nomic system. In order to fight for climate, you have to pass through the economic system which is enable by the political power being their biggest threat, not just for environment, also for socie-ty. So I asked myself: Wouldn\u00b4t be nice to design an alternative system that allows to the people to be self-sufficient, non-governmental dependent and that allows to thrive within the planetary boundaries? Multiscalar diagram Other trigger that I have in mind was the Circular Economy and Climate Justice. At these moments I am thinking that there are many examples that address the climate crisis in a personal or domestic sphere, but what about in a corporate level or a SMEs level, with activities rather than residues separation or energy saving. If we are naming that economic system is the biggest threat to climate, so how can business could make a transition to a less harm or regenera-tive system. At the moment I have many questions that are going in different directions. Another question is how can we increase climate conscience to push people to a paradigm shift in their economic activities? Can climate conscience be the end? Or is a way to an end? If these is the case, what it would be de end? Until today my biggest concern are the resources management or self-sufficiency and the econom-ic system. I\u2019m still working in this scales Collaborative design space Finding resonance At these point with my peers at the panel 5 State Futures - Land justice - distributed infrastructure = redistribution of opportunities - Post- passport - displacement - authorities- social movements - Radical Tech -Political Tech Futures, I feel that I was pushing the agenda for self-sufficiency re-gions or maybe in domestic. I tried to make the connections between some triggers like the reuse of tech like a strategy for self-sufficiency and also how it could lead to a change in the economic system Next steps \u2013Someone you would like to contact Fab cities El Hierro, Blue Economy example, M\u00f3nica Navarro, CEO y Co-Fundadora de Delicious & Sons, type B business example.

Basically the equipment allows us to distill any substance present in the plants. The amazing part is that it took a lot of Laurel\u2019s leave just to make a small production of essential oil. It is considerable the amount of resources needed to that kind of production. Design a mutant \u00b6 PET-eater Mycelium \u00b6 *References https://2019.igem.org/Team:Humboldt_Berlin/Description http://2016.igem.org/Team:Tianjin/Description The example from inspiration talks about an algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii used as a chassis for having an enzyme that can break the polymers chains into monomers by degrading it basically with two kinds of enzymes, PETase and MHETase. The PETase degrades PET into MHET (mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid) and MHETase degrades MHET into TPA (terephthalic acid) and EG (ethylene glycol). So my mutant is to take a Mycelium as a chassis with this types of enzymes and spread it in landfills in which there are the most amount of the PET unused, mixed therefore un-recycled. The objective is degrading the most amount of PET available in a Landfill and reduce the volume of it, allowing other process for handle the mixed waste more efficiently. Scientific paper review \u00b6 Mycelium as a biological network (an example of biomimicry). \u00b6 From the example shared in the seminar about the networks created from mycelium, I start reading and searching more about this. If we can talk about the flow of nutrients in the mycelium network could be used as a biomimicry concept extrapolated to different kinds of networks; as an example if we talk about decentralized manufacturing, we can design routes for or networks of local manufacturers, craftsman or workshops as input of flow or as a node then we can distribute the \u201cnutrient\u201d created by them in the network. Each node or manufacture will metabolize a good that could be flow as a nutrient in the must optimal path within the network. Could it be the same as the Graph Theory and find the optimal way to transfer atoms, instead of having big manufactures, we can have smaller ones with less consumption of resources, less environmental impact, more cooperation and wealth distribution. Create networks for distribute atoms from a biomimicry approach.

If we can talk about the flow of nutrients in the mycelium network could be used as a biomimicry concept extrapolated to different kinds of networks; as an example if we talk about decentralized manufacturing, we can design routes for or networks of local manufacturers, craftsman or workshops as input of flow or as a node then we can distribute the \u201cnutrient\u201d created by them in the network. Each node or manufacture will metabolize a good that could be flow as a nutrient in the must optimal path within the network.

Insight \u00b6 One thing that I can catch from the dynamic is that when you put yourself in the 1pp perspective you can use your own self context and body in order to reflect in the other anything. In that action you can see yourself reflected at the same time, therefore you recognize something about yourself in the other and the similarities start to appearing, having at some point some level of empathy. That maybe can be obvious in some point but it is clear for me and I hope that is the same with others, that one design for the other, the interaction between people or designing for people and whit people shape us. We have to design having in mind the other person, we could design for connection, meaningful interaction or whatever; but the main thing that shape our design is designing for the other, it shapes us, shape our practice and shape the characteristics of the interventions. Design for the other make us empathetic and humble, realizing that, no matter what, always has to be another self, another entity that at the end has to thrive trough the design intervention. With that in mind the design activity makes us humbles, emphatics and vulnerable, and make sense with the words from Ron Wakkary to Arturo Escobar, etc. Not many people are willing to be vulnerable or empathic (for their own reasons), and the question that lies here is, can we teach to the non-designer how to design for the other in order to transform them into a more emphatic been? Can a non-designer design for another entity such as the environment? Therefore, having a meaningful rapport. Can the non-designer could be more emphatic with the environment or immigrants, when he, she or they are designing with them and for them? The point is understanding why if must of the people is aware of the environmental and social crisis caused by capitalism, no one is willing to make a radical change or systemic change. 1PP EXPLORATION \u00b6 Searching for meaningful interactions \u00b6 Guided reflection. \u00b6 Briefly: \u2022 What did you make? And why did it matter? I tried to have interactions with people in the street, as first attempt because I found important to be relatable with people I is an effort to understand how to connect with people in different ways or levels. For me is more to develop a skill because at one point we have design with other and for others, and in order to do that, we as designers need to understand how to engage properly with people or communities in a horizontal and participatory level for having meaningful design outcomes \u2022 What happens when you involve yourself? For me 1pp I tried to understand it as an exercise for exploration of an idea, but in some point, because of the nature of my exploration, it became blurry at first the line between an exploration and an ethnography. \u2022 What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? Many things happen during the exercise, I tried to adapt myself and to have creative responses, but at the end everything flows perfectly when the interaction starts spontaneously. Another thing is that in some point of the interaction I became aware that I was in a roll of designer making an investigation of the subjects so I try to just relax and be a subject of experiences that was a meaningful interaction. In that point I stop to worried about the information or how I was going to present the exploration. At the end I accomplish the goal of my exploration which was to have a meaningful interaction. \u2022 Did anything change about your way of working? It changed a lot that day, in first place because at first I made an attempt to approach people but I think it was in some way disruptive and not pleasant for them to interrupt them, it doesn\u2019t matter if they were not doing anything and form it was not spontaneous from my side, I choose who to approach and how to start the conversation and also I was feeling insecure because I was having a little bit of a cold in those days. The second attempt was more easy because I identify a group of people which I know we have common interest or at least something in common. As a result, I got a meaningful interaction and the only thing that I had to do was to go there with them, spontaneously. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work? That if we try to design the social interaction most of the time we are going to have random outcomes, so in a way a design for social intervention could be designed for or with some degree of randomness and spontaneity. \u2022 After seeing the videos of your collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? I found amazing work of the collective, with a topic that could be explored in deeper or critical way such as the contextualization/decontextualization of the objects performed by Andrea, that approach could be used as tool for criticism, also the context/empathy exercise from Busy and Angel offers a good perspective of understanding the world could function if we are not the same person with the same qualities as we are now. Also I found very interesting the approaches of comparing or analyzing the products we use or how we as consumers waste.

We stating talking about our feeling in the moment and creating a general concept that was around loneliness and happiness. After that the most difficult part, in my opinion was to understand the logical part of the code in order to make the machine work and understanding what extra components were needed. For me a difficult task at the moment has been understanding the logical process for coding and the language used for Arduino. Until know I have not previous experience using this component but is a skill I want to develop in my time at IAAC. Another reflection was to see the esthetics and the function of having a \u201ccase\u201d for the circuits that power the machine, manufactured from cardboard allowing us to made them in the moment and with the flexibility to add or remove circuits, boards and intervene the circuit for repair it. That is an example how appliances or other tech devices could be designed and manufactured under a different paradigm as the actual linear and mass production one. iMac Destructor \u00b6 Visit the link for the report iMac Destructor Reflections \u00b6 The styling slavery???\u2026dictatorship??..mmm working Title \u00b6 Disassembling the iMac 2006 , was for me like a magician trick, the one in which he keeps pulling out infinite amount of handkerchiefs form his sleeve. As we were disassembling the different part of the computer we were finding seals, screws, foils, plates, tapes, cables, connectors, board, drivers, frames, big parts and smaller parts. One can\u2019t avoid thinking about the un-recyclability or re-usability (in the best case scenario) of those components. Must of the circuits board are still operational, but not much efficiently in comparison with the newest devices. From one side, we could appreciate the form and style of the case of different appliances, and one cannot stop thinking about how this external cases are just a pretext for the design styling that satisfy an imposed need for aesthetics. This styling lead to design and manufacture artifacts and appliances as black boxes totally away of the consumer\u2019s hands. Maybe if we remove this cases could be spoken about more durable appliances and artifacts with universal drivers and motherboards, that you can used and shared, no matter is for a TV or a PC or whatever. For other, at the present times, from the design and engineering point of view it doesn\u2019t makes sense to keep designing with the same logic dictated by the market and the business models of the companies, that in order to survive (give us work and pay us money to eat) they must sell as many objects as fastest and cheapest they can. What would happen if courses like de MDEF could be more open and in some way attractive to students from a broader background or disciplines, like accounting, marketing, finance? How can we keep them away from the MBAs? In enterprises like Apple, the design department probably is not as bigger as the law or accounting department. As designers, how can communicate and motivate other disciplines to design under new paradigms of consumption? such paradigm may have to respond to the real needs of the people, and not to the survival necessities of the business model of a company. If we as a designers and engineers, know from fact that the technology would be obsolete in a few years, why don\u2019t we design appliances and artifacts with that as guide? Can appliances and objects could be designed from scraps parts or generic parts without a case, designed for grown in time? How these appliances could look like without a stylish case? One think that I notice when the iMac was being disassembled, was that the sole act of manually handle the object produce some emotional reaction in the user, in these case the person that disassembled it. And I remember that in some point John Wood mention that another perspective to make a sustainable design is to have one object which the user would never trough it away. With that in mind, can we design appliances and artifacts that could stablish an emotional bonding with the user in order to never be discarded? Maybe we can design objects in which the user has to be more involved from the \u201cbirth\u201d of the appliance, from selecting the material, the origin, the motherboards, the function that would perform and assembly it by himself, and keep it always updated and never obsolete.

Can I produce the ingredients of my meals at home or my neighborhood? hypothesis: I CAN PRODUCE THE INGREDIENTS OF MY MEALS AT HOME OR MY NEIGHBORHOOD. Tips \u00b6 We recommend that, in order to realize the experiment properly, we require to collect data during the year, because of the time of growth of the plants. Nutritional data is required to estimate possible species to grow, and therefore the space demanded for a person to grow his food. In addition, being aware that particles in the air and other gases might affect the correct development of plants. And, try to not be around the sensor while it is doing the measurement because it affect the results. From hypothesis to data \u00b6 Tools selection \u00b6 We chose the CITIZEN SENSING TOOLKIT http://making-sense.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Citizen-Sensing-A-Toolkit.pdf We selected it because we wanted to figure out how is the weather (temperature, humidity, light, eCO2, eVO2) in the possible free spots to grow food in the neighborhood and compare it to what the plants require to grow there. Tool usage documentation \u00b6 The process can be replicated using the same Citizen Sensing Toolkit , what we recommend is to do it at different times a day and in all the seasons if it is referred to growing plants. Check the outliers when you download the information. Data capturing strategy \u00b6 First, we choose the places that are already working as urban gardens, then we start thinking of possible places that might be used to check if they can be used to growing the food, and what types of food might be there. The data was taken from 14:30pm to 16:30pm in 7 places that we checked before start. Then we download the data in the laptop to start the cleaning of the information. Materials needed \u00b6 Smart citizen kit sensor USB cable Computer to configure the SCK Cell phone to connect the SCK using WiFi connection, and take pictures and videos to documentation. Detail setup instructions \u00b6 The first step is to connect the battery. The kit will light in red (configuration mode) Sign up to the Smart Citizen Platfom When the light is red, the CSK is ready to set up, either by WiFi or SD Card connection When the light is blue, the SCK is on Wi-Fi connection. In this way, the device will publish the data every minute on the smartcitizen.me platform When the SCK is pink, it is on offline mode and is saving the information on the SD Card When we measured, we pressed the button once until the light turnd pink, we measured for 10 minutes then switched it to standy turning the light red Find a good and clear location to place the Citizen Sensing Toolkit . If you need to measure light, make sure it is \u201cface up\u201d. Data collected \u00b6 Using the Smart citizen kit, we planned to visit 6 different locations to gather data on light quality, humidity, Temperature and particle matter.

D\u2019ICARIA CEMETERY PARC MARIPOSA CARRER DE PUJADES The raw data is provided in spreadsheets: Tips \u00b6 We would have to measure with multiple devices in order to have the conditions in different places at the same time of the day and for a longer time Data capture \u00b6 Data summary \u00b6 Data Summary Project Title Urban Gardeners Capture Start 11-11-2021 Capture End 12-11-2021 Original Data Format CSV file Submitted format CSV file Total Data Points 359 Number of datasets 2 Data Repository https://github.com/fablabbcn/mdef-a-world-in-data/tree/main/urban-gardeners Optimal Conditions \u00b6 Data insights \u00b6 We compared the data captured in the 7 spots. To improve the data: - We would need to take measurements of all year and at the same time in different places. - In order to have an efficient use of the space for producing the plants, we would have to measure characteristics of the soil as well (nutrients, chemicals, ph, etc.) - Other parameters could be taken into account: available time of people to take care of it, space available. Raw data We used google sheet pivot tables to agregate data into averages by location and also to focus on specific parameters. Average of data by location Focus of each location data to remove potential outliers Comparision bubble chart x = temperature y = light diameter of the bubbles = CO2 particules We displayed the ideal location conditions needed for the 4 vegetables we studied above. Potatoes, carrots : not any location studied respond to the requirement of light needed Lettuce, tomatoes : only the rooftop of IAAC would allow us to grow these! We need to continue the research on the vegetables that we can grow in the winter season with very little light. Tips and biais \u00b6 We didn\u2019t pay attention to the noise sensor so we made some noise discussing just next to the sensor during the data capturing. It would be interesting to stay silent or go further during the recording so we can see how much frequentation there is in the different locations. Scale the process : To record more accurate and more comparable data, it would be better to record a full day and not just 10 minutes to know how much light the location gets. Here we just recorded 10 minutes in each spot and not at the same time of the day (between 1pm and 4:30pm).","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars%201%20Term/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars%201%20Term/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#the-almost-useful-machines","text":"Here you can check the video","title":"The Almost Useful Machines"},{"location":"seminars%201%20Term/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#the-loner-booth-presentation","text":"Presentation","title":"The Loner Booth presentation"},{"location":"seminars%201%20Term/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#the-loner-booth-reflections","text":"The Loner Booth concept was created during the process of knowing the parts of tech that we have at hand and to recognizing their potential.

One can\u2019t avoid thinking about the un-recyclability or re-usability (in the best case scenario) of those components. Must of the circuits board are still operational, but not much efficiently in comparison with the newest devices. From one side, we could appreciate the form and style of the case of different appliances, and one cannot stop thinking about how this external cases are just a pretext for the design styling that satisfy an imposed need for aesthetics. This styling lead to design and manufacture artifacts and appliances as black boxes totally away of the consumer\u2019s hands. Maybe if we remove this cases could be spoken about more durable appliances and artifacts with universal drivers and motherboards, that you can used and shared, no matter is for a TV or a PC or whatever. For other, at the present times, from the design and engineering point of view it doesn\u2019t makes sense to keep designing with the same logic dictated by the market and the business models of the companies, that in order to survive (give us work and pay us money to eat) they must sell as many objects as fastest and cheapest they can. What would happen if courses like de MDEF could be more open and in some way attractive to students from a broader background or disciplines, like accounting, marketing, finance? How can we keep them away from the MBAs? In enterprises like Apple, the design department probably is not as bigger as the law or accounting department. As designers, how can communicate and motivate other disciplines to design under new paradigms of consumption? such paradigm may have to respond to the real needs of the people, and not to the survival necessities of the business model of a company. If we as a designers and engineers, know from fact that the technology would be obsolete in a few years, why don\u2019t we design appliances and artifacts with that as guide? Can appliances and objects could be designed from scraps parts or generic parts without a case, designed for grown in time? How these appliances could look like without a stylish case? One think that I notice when the iMac was being disassembled, was that the sole act of manually handle the object produce some emotional reaction in the user, in these case the person that disassembled it. And I remember that in some point John Wood mention that another perspective to make a sustainable design is to have one object which the user would never trough it away. With that in mind, can we design appliances and artifacts that could stablish an emotional bonding with the user in order to never be discarded? Maybe we can design objects in which the user has to be more involved from the \u201cbirth\u201d of the appliance, from selecting the material, the origin, the motherboards, the function that would perform and assembly it by himself, and keep it always updated and never obsolete. Could it be a game changer ? or just greenwashing ??

At first, my objective was to work on design politics, since I consider it a powerful practice to shape our future from another perspective and it is often neglected in design or seen as a taboo; what I was leaving aside is the lack of structure to frame this practice in a transformative collective activity, as I was planning the intervention of the design from my ego and not from the echo, the design works with the others.

Topics that are totally outside my field of expertise, but it is interesting to understand all the technological tools that are available to be able to have a more nurturing and responsive design practice to current times, allowing us to have design responses that we had never imagined. The first week we focused on Machine Learning through datasets and training. On a personal level I lack a lot of vocabulary and understanding about coding and programming, but the point of the master is to understand and use as much as possible. At this seminar we did different activities based on the image datasets. In this particular example we start from datasets that are formed from images of portraits which, when mixed, generate a realistic portrait of a person that does not exist. Through intelligence training, infinite results can be generated by mixing the different information available in each dataset to create images that are realistic but beyond the normal imagination. In the case of portraits, it is difficult to identify the creations of intelligence to the real ones. From this process we carry out two different exercises. The first was to create a dataset from the images obtained from our cell phones around Poblenou to observe the process carried out by the training, in this case we saw how this training classified the images and surprising images were generated from this dataset. EmiliObama The second exercise was in teams in which we used different trainings available on the network to create merged images. We sought in this exercise to create a dataset of our personal objects, which were a reflection of our personality and from this, create new objects from this data set. We seek to create a card game which would be the recipient of this identity creation, taking as an example reference such as the Buzzfeed personality quizzes which tells you what kind of pizza you are, or what Disney princess you are. From this exercise, I was able to observe the infinite capacity for creation that an intelligence with sufficient training and sufficient databases can have. Presentation link \u00b6 Artificial Identities Generator Derived from this activity we find different examples such as Philipp Schmitt, who through training and certain input the computer can design and create an object in this case it is a chair, the result is an image of a non-existent product but that being interpreted by a designer you arrive at a finished product, but in certain examples not so functional. https://nips2018creativity.github.io/doc/the_chair_project.pdf Which raises a question, if it is possible that the intelligences with enough dataset can design with the minimum of information. Currently, consumer products manufacturing and sales are dictated by the market rules and its imposed trends in fashion and aesthetics, therefore, this product are subject to a temporality shorter than its useful life, this business model has a result in an overexploitation of the natural resources and in the same time creates a difference between social classes from the creation of luxury products, giving an undeserved power to designers. It could be that, through a trained intelligence, the access to any product could be democratized, giving the power of the designer to a person with no level of training, removing designers, brand companies based on marketing from the business model. Rethinking their own needs without a market bias, users can express their needs in an understandable medium by intelligence and from this input and with the dataset and the necessary training, products could be designed and manufactured as the users demands and not to the demand of a business model. Probably there is enough products created in the world for creating an almost infinite database for not to design any product again. Extended intelligence \u00b6 In the second week we deepened in the understanding about what intelligence was and how it was perceived and created, which generated a series of questions. During this week we work on the speculative case of how to create intelligence in an object, based on this questioning we select a study table or class room table, within an ordinary classroom; the function of the table is to generate stimuli that allow students to maintain continuous attention to classes. The table obtains the necessary information through different sensors inside it, which allow it to detect when the student begins to be distracted, these stimuli are the blinking speed, the frequency of body movements and brainwaves. At the moment in which certain values of each measurement are reached, the table unleashes a stimulus on the student in the form of an electroshocks in the elbows, which allows the student to return to a state of mindfulness.
