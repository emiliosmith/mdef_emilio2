# Living with your own ideas

The empathy machine
At first it is baffling to try to understand the velocity of the seminars but I understand the valuable of building knowledge through the making of prototypes.
For this assignment of having one self as a mirror for design for other (1pp), the question: “what magic machine could help me in my life?” was without doubt a machine that could tell me what the other people is felling, and not only to know the felling but to feel what they feel, to feel it in my own body.
Picture
So basically my magic machine it’s a device connected to the head of the subject and then a cord connects the head device to an interface for my hand from I get to feel trough touching with a special glove

And give it a second though with the comments of Oscar and Kristina I put a lot of filter for just understand to other people.


Insight
One thing that I can catch from the dynamic is that when you put yourself in the 1pp perspective you can use your own self context and body in order to reflect in the other anything.  In that action you can see yourself reflected at the same time, therefore you recognize something about yourself in the other and the similarities start to appearing, having at some point some level of empathy.

That maybe can be obvious in some point but it is clear for me and I hope that is the same with others, that one design for the other, the interaction between people or designing for people and whit people shape us. We have to design having in mind the other person, we could design for connection, meaningful interaction or whatever; but the main thing that shape our design is designing for the other, it shapes us, shape our practice and shape the characteristics of the interventions.

Design for the other make us empathetic and humble, realizing that, no matter what, always has to be another self, another entity that at the end has to thrive trough the design intervention.

With that in mind the design activity makes us humbles, emphatics and vulnerable, and make sense with the words from Ron Wakkary to Arturo Escobar, etc.

Not many people are willing to be vulnerable or empathic (for their own reasons), and the question that lies here is, can we teach to the non-designer how to design for the other in order to transform them into a more emphatic been? Can a non-designer design for another entity such as the environment? Therefore, having a meaningful rapport.
Can the non-designer could be more emphatic with the environment or immigrants, when he, she or they are designing with them and for them?

The point is understanding why if must of the people is aware of the environmental and social crisis caused by capitalism, no one is willing to make a radical change or systemic change.
