# Second intervention 2


## INTERVIEWING THE COMPOST ECOSYSTEM

For this design interventions, we started by collecting knowledge, and expertise from different actors inside the compost ecosystem.

In this recollection, we met from an enthusiast of a greener life, experts in circular food systems, and a community engagement.

As a result, we could have a broader understanding of the complexity in each case and different insights for framing a design question.
