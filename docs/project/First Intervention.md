# First intervention


For our first design intervention we decided to engage with people of different bakcgrounds to encouraged them for making his/her compost though a workshop, planned to communicate the process and develop the skills needed.

COMPANION COMPOST BACKGROUND

Companions Compost is the result of our first design interventions framed in the first term. Working with compost is a path that I understand as an activity that could work at an individual, community, and city level.

This project starts with Rei Matsuoka's research about food waste; her research talks about how the food is managed inside a Combini store (food store in Japan). This is an example of how an unsustainable system works, in which it is not considered an alternative or the environmental or social impact of it. In that context, making
compost is an activity that could be a sustainable alternative for taking the food waste and transforming it into new food through a closed-loop system.

In her research, Rei also describes how the food system is on Iwai Island, a small island where the habitants manage their few resources available in a circular way. The food waste is used to feed the livestock; then, the organic waste of this livestock is added to the compost; This compost is employed in the soil for growing food for
self-consumption.
