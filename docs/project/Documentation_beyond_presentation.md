# Documentation beyond presentation

##Refelction of my documentation process


in process !!!!
Oh, my documentation process is bad, really really bad
Main points
in proc
-Not get used to it, in the work doensn apreciate
use to slideshow
-thinking to much in the Media
not handle well video tools, cameras or video editor , cero experience
In this escenario i tried to give a meaning the documentation and used as a mean to research a tpic of my iterest behavior, so in found the graphs and start mapind with the material i have
the assiagmen is difficult because you have to be in two places and be aware of both task
I was difficult because I wasnt know what to expect from the dynamic
knowing that now i could do thing different

At first , one thing that I have noticed is that I am not used no make a good documentation. Must of the time the previous documentation that I have made is for my personal process; in my worklife a good documentation is not valuable as much as the final result. In my past experience, must clients doesn't value it or it is perceived as an extra. For us it was important to show how we arrived to the final solution so, to that end, we used to made a basic slide show, with some pictures and results.
Other thing that I know for fact, is that I lack of the general skills for a good documentation, I am not used to get track of the steps of a good documentation, futhermore I lack the skills for using tools for make visually appealling.
