# Week 18 FabAcademy


## Invention, intellectual property and income

During this class we have a discussion with Oscar and Victor about the different implications around a project such as Smart Citizen. We discuss about the perspective of creating value to the user using the infrastructure created with Smart Citizen in particular the use of Intellectual Property.

We made an exercise to imagine an alternative to generate income in a innovative way using different approaches, postures or resources.

At the end our proposal ought to use the way Smart Citizen gather data in favor to enterprises or companies in order to use to search spaces to avoid environmental regulations.
