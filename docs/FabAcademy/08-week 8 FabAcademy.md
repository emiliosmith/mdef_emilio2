# Week 8 FabAcademy

## Embedded Programming
In this week we saw a brief history about computing and some programing languages are used regarding the purposes or the platform where they were built.
For me it is always a hard topic to understand how to coding or choose the language and their logic. But so far with the many help of many classmates and all in the FabLab I managed to get something done.
Third Eye
Or this project I manage to code a ESP in Arduino for having a lecture for the photoresitor and define a threshold.
When the lecture of the photoresitor pass the value of the threshold the instruction was to turn on a LED in a defined Pin; when the value went below the threshold the instruction was to turn off the LED, everything in a loop.
We use this circuit for the concept of our artifact the Third Eye;

Weekly Challenge III
For the weekly challenge we program a ESP to have a lecture from a Humidity sensor and calibrate it. Because the lecture of a sensor is in values that goes from 0 to 4095, we have to program the instruction for transforming the values to percentages of humidity.
