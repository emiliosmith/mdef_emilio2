# DESIGNING YOURSELF OUT.


After this final intervention, which at this point is far from the finish, I have changed my perspective on collaboration, and participation. There are many things that a person can accomplish by herself or himself, but when the personal will is put into the service of the community, true change happens.

For having a productive city[D1], neighborhoods, and blocks, we have to empower creative communities, create networks and collaborate as a part of the collective. From the design perspective, I learned to be empathic and to have a user-friendly perspective, but in the MDEF journey, we started by embodying an idea and taking it to a community, not to validate it, but to share it as an equal.

In my experience as a designer, working in a design studio, I have explored different approaches for professional practice, so the next steps could be very complex.

An MDEF structure for design practice is needed because of the agency of the interventions from the Weak Signals and the Cognitive Ecologies [D2] present in every region, not from sustaining business as usual but for creating new collaboration paradigms (WHY).


We have to design systems with others in their context for regeneration (WHAT); As mentioned by Ezio Manzini[D3], everyone can design in a way, professional and non-professional, everyone in a community is a contributor and collaborator(WHO).
