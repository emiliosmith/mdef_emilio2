# Design for the next billion seconds

##Reflection

These seminar was quite interesting because we have the opportunity to be more immersive in a speculative and imaginative practice for envision a future.
We have the opportunity to be more critic about the current system that surround us and how we surrender our will to them without been conscious about this.
From a sustainable-futurist-regenerative design practice it is a basic step a tool to take time to critique and to understand and project the possible repercussions of our present actions in the future. by analyzing the present crisis, we can infer that sometimes that the problems that we try to solve today are going to be the problems of tomorrow

##WTF is the internet
Gato
With these exercise we have to reflect about the future and the past, about the internet and the time. This concept often gives them by granted and we didnâ€™t realize how they shape our lives therefore our practice.
