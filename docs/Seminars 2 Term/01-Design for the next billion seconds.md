# Design for the next billion seconds

##Reflection

These seminar was quite interesting because we have the opportunity to be more immersive in a speculative and imaginative practice for envision a future.
We have the opportunity to be more critic about the current system that surround us and how we surrender our will to them without been conscious about this.
From a sustainable-futurist-regenerative design practice it is a basic step a tool to take time to critique and to understand and project the possible repercussions of our present actions in the future. by analyzing the present crisis, we can infer that sometimes that the problems that we try to solve today are going to be the problems of tomorrow

##WTF is the internet


With these exercise we have to reflect about the future and the past, about the internet and the time. This concept often gives them by granted and we didnâ€™t realize how they shape our lives therefore our practice.

##A day in 2052

The second activity was to work with a partner a reflect from a series of questions about how our personal life would be in a Billions seconds in the future.
From the different presentations we can notice patterns about our futures like self-sufficiency and to be in harmony with the natural environment.

##Lagos 2052

This collaborative project was about choosing a subject for focusing the description of a city in 2052.
Our decision was to base our imaginary city in Lagos, Nigeria; from these we have to search about the expectation about this city and the past history in order to detect trends for our description and to design the speculation of how the city would look like and how it will perform in 2052.
Understanding past situations as colonialism and slavery and look how city with these background have thrived is an opportunity to reflect and compare how the geopolitics and capitalism have been shaping the world a how if nothing is done in the present, the future could be worse.
At the end we perform a political statement describing our city in front of a world summit.
