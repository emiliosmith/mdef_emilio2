#Collective Intelligence


This seminar was quite challenging for me, because of my lack of knowledge in the area, and that let me to open the discussion of the word “collective”. In a way, could the high tech terms or practices alienate the gross part of the population?
There are so many topics, uses and leverage that can be applied into our daily life for retake some control about the economics, the information that we “give” and the freedom of the internet of things. Is in this contexts because our lack of knowledge or accountability that tools like the Gemini protocol could be used to gain the way internet and the sharable knowledge are supposed to be, without an intermediate that is mining our information and pushing economic interest of others.


New models based on a distributed network like block chain could be an example of how could we start to migrate to a new paradigm, maybe not the best option or it is not proved enough, but it is worth to try it.
Understanding how protocols works in the interconnectedness and the difference with platforms was the hardest part but is the first step to recognize the accountability in the use of our data and our freedom. Ourselves as users we neglect the externalities in the internet for many reason, because the lack of understanding of because we only want to have the good, without the bad.


During this seminar we have a broader understanding of what really mean the use the internet by knowing the concept of Web 2.0, 3.0 and the respective vision in which these concepts are based on.


Blockchain is part of a decentralize vision of a system, which is horizontal, bottom up and validated by other, totally opposed to the current monetary system which it´s only valid by few global institutions, a centralized system.


As part of these decentralized efforts is the bitcoin and others types of cryptocurrency which allow the users to have a way to sustain or profit without the validation of a regulatory authority like a bank. This kind of exchange can be a starting point for jump into some different economic paradigms, away of conventionalism that keep profit by our labor.


In the seminar we saw the example of a different model based this structure, Akasha and its different hubs are an example of organizations that rely in this technology and truly believe in doing thing differently. This are models that encourage and motivate other to imagine a different paradigm for organizations.  


For me it is a challenge to have a deeper understanding how this technology works and how as user could be part of this, if it not a final destination, at least would be a way to make a transition to a different model, a statement to other people that can´t see how capitalism could end.
