# Future Talks

##Audrey Desjardines.
###First Person Perspective, Autoethnography

This lecture was from Audrey Desjardines.
She gave us a perspective from the design research process that she has been carry on.


It was a good opportunity to understand and to know different approaches for the design process.


She explains briefly the differences between First Person Perspective, Auto ethnography and that practices are more common in the social science; from the examples that Audrey use, for me was clearer the difference between this approaches and the research process in a linear process or conventional, like the one developed by IDEO.


This method for research present different challenges, from the documentations methods to the perspective or bias of the researcher, but at the same time is a good way to make a project richer. As a designer and researcher to maintain a broader approach in the process eventually is going to lead you to a variety of insights, questions, results and interpretations that hardly could have been obtained by other methods. It allows you to have discussions, and is a way to learn by doing in the process, to embodied the solution with the knowledge that you as a researcher are going to gain in that process.


Certainly is a different approach from a conventional design school of what I am used to, but whit out a doubt despite the barriers is an opportunity to let the solution emerge by itself without pushing it by a commercial agenda.     


## Sergio Urue√±a
### Responsive Innovation

- Be responsible and with a political notion and use it for framework the innovation within a design project.
- How can we shape better society with better technology, but by who and with whom?

With Sergio we review different examples of how science, technology and innovations have shaped our world and have change our social dynamics, but at the same time help us to shape the future in a way of how we imagine the science and technologies breakthrough mostly a technological determinism as a counter part of social constructivism; at the end we have to realize that in time the hybridize, shaping each other.

At the center of this materialism are as well designers, therefore we have to understand the responsibility in this process. In other hand is fundamental to understand the relationship between society, technology and innovation and how it interaction is framed also by institutions and governments in order to push an agenda.


The socio-technical approach allows us to understand the many relationships between the STI and the many layers in society. Accountability and access are a strong issue in STI because in many places are used or neglected by a dominant group, it is our duty to realize that our efforts have to dismantle this and work for a more accessible and horizontal dynamics in society.


Sergio as well present us a framework for RRI responsabilization, with 4 basic dimensions: Inclusions, Reflexivity, Responsiveness and Anticipation.

To recognize which system, actors, and futures are we empowering through our projects in a real context, where the final people can engage with it.


During the different terms, in the project, we have been detailing the people involve, and how we are going to present the information of the project, and eventually is shaping the design intervention, transforming and nourishing the ultimate design deliverable.
This design deliverable at the end will be shaped by the participation of the people that we worked through the different design interventions.

With our project of compost commune we noticed that the users could be very broad and diverse due to how well we can co-design a network between them. Another mindset that prevail during this process was the scalability of the network but thinking that can happen without our intervention, that in some point the people will engage in the practice of regeneration and will appropriate all the knowledge and making a strong community, having impact in different level of the socio political sphere.
