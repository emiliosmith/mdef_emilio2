# Future Talks

##Audrey Desjardines.
###First Person Perspective, Autoethnography

This lecture was from Audrey Desjardines.
She gave us a perspective from the design research process that she has been carry on.


It was a good opportunity to understand and to know different approaches for the design process.


She explains briefly the differences between First Person Perspective, Auto ethnography and that practices are more common in the social science; from the examples that Audrey use, for me was clearer the difference between this approaches and the research process in a linear process or conventional, like the one developed by IDEO.


This method for research present different challenges, from the documentations methods to the perspective or bias of the researcher, but at the same time is a good way to make a project richer. As a designer and researcher to maintain a broader approach in the process eventually is going to lead you to a variety of insights, questions, results and interpretations that hardly could have been obtained by other methods. It allows you to have discussions, and is a way to learn by doing in the process, to embodied the solution with the knowledge that you as a researcher are going to gain in that process.


Certainly is a different approach from a conventional design school of what I am used to, but whit out a doubt despite the barriers is an opportunity to let the solution emerge by itself without pushing it by a commercial agenda.
